UX researchers use generative research methods that rely on direct
observation, deep inquiry, and careful analysis---to understand their
users, what they care about, how they think, and what motivates their
behavior.

‚Äç\

The data collected through this research helps *generate* ideas and
*discover* opportunities to innovate and improve solutions that meet a
real and specific need in the market.¬†

‚Äç\

In this module, you'll learn all about conducting

-   **Literature reviews,** in which researchers collect, analyze, and
    synthesize published data to integrate \'known knowns\' into future
    projects.
-   **Generative user interviews.** In-depth, 1-on-1 interviews involve
    talking to participants and asking them a set of non-leading
    questions about behaviors, beliefs, and habits.
-   **Ethnography** and **field studies.** Ethnographic research
    involves observing participants in natural (non-lab) settings.
-   **Diary studies**, which offer insights into user habits, changes
    over time, motivations, and long-term customer journeys.¬†
-   **Focus groups**. In the early stages of research, this method can
    be a useful way to get a broad-strokes view of your target
    audience.¬†
-   **Card sorting**, a technique for finding patterns in how people
    understand and categorize information.¬†

Although UX researchers tend to focus heavily on primary research
methods, secondary methods like literature reviews can reveal
fundamental insights that ground our decision-making in established
theory and real-life context.¬†

‚Äç

Like user insights leader Xenia Avezov says in ["Secondary research is
chronically underused in UX
research"](https://medium.com/@xenia.avezov/leverage-secondary-research-in-your-user-research-practice-part-i-b1cd06dffc81):

‚Äç

> "Research that is not grounded in the systemic, environmental, and
> psychological nature of human problems is often incomplete. Secondary
> research empowers us to incorporate these perspectives and reframe
> problems in a holistic way."

‚Äç

More pragmatically: Why waste your limited resources on rediscovering
info that other researchers have already found? Literature reviews allow
you to *reduce, reuse, and recycle* insights, minimizing your research
footprint and maximizing your impact-to-effort ratio.¬†

What is a research literature review?¬†
--------------------------------------

\
A **literature review** (also called a '**lit review**' or '**desk
research**') is a type of [secondary
research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/secondary-research-in-ux/) in
which researchers collect, analyze, and synthesize published
data---including articles, websites, videos, research journals, and
existing [research
repositories](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/librarians-on-uxr-insights-repositories-nada-alnakeeb-joanna-perez)---on
a topic, in order to identify patterns and trends.¬†

‚Äç

Unlike primary research, which *you* conduct to answer the research
question at hand, secondary research was conducted by *other*
researchers. (The exception to this would be if you were using research
that *you previously conducted* (after all, you were a different person
back then). Most of the secondary research you'll find was likely
conducted for purposes unrelated to your project or product, but a
thorough and focused literature review can help you consolidate relevant
data and boost your confidence in your own research questions.¬†

‚Äç

Literature reviews are commonly associated with university
theses---sometimes taking months or years to complete in an academic
setting---and some researchers leave this method behind when they move
onto a business environment. But lit reviews deserve a place in any UX
research toolkit, whether you're working on a post-doctorate or a food
delivery app.¬†

‚Äç

‚è∞ To maximize the value gained for the time spent, UX researchers will
probably want to limit the scope of their literature reviews to **5
hours or less**, but it really depends on the topic and the resources
available.

‚Äç

![Outputs, time required, and decisions made with literature
reviews](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/62ea8804096bbafb2a22be44_QwyU2-QmBAvqwN1UxHEAVzekybk8IXi_i1XJdoAVw_N8-joxutbBNyN90fmBEsiVdIFTYmMR5FnWkmupQRulthXRcS6MQVcna26SbhU820Qc1jpmCd4hTWnKP7yIhSOhoQdZjrGDQBS1fDgQveU6Xmc.png)

‚Äç

#### **What kind of decisions do literature reviews help with?**¬†

\
Literature reviews are typically used to inform visionary or strategic
decisions related to a product or service.¬†

‚Äç

For example, you might conduct a literature review to answer [user
research
questions](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-questions)
like:

-   What is our competitive advantage with our newest product line?
-   How are our target customers managing their challenges without our
    product or service?

‚Äç

#### **What should you include in a literature review?**¬†

\
Literature reviews require lots of reading, so researchers often use
spreadsheets or documents to keep track of their sources and make note
of key insights.¬†

‚Äç

The output of a literature review is a written report that is structured
to include:

-   An overview of the project, including the research questions and
    goals
-   A summary of each of the sources included
-   An evaluation or critique of each source, comparing and contrasting
    key insights
-   A discussion of biases or weaknesses
-   Suggestions for future research or decision-making

‚Äç

### What are the different types of literature reviews (and how do you know which one to use)?

\
There are several types of literature reviews, and each one requires a
different amount of time, effort, and resources:¬†

-   **Systematic literature reviews** are the most rigorous form of
    literature review, aiming to summarize as much of the relevant
    research as possible with little to no bias. They can take anywhere
    from 8 months to *2 years*, requiring 2 or more researchers to
    complete. (You may sometimes hear systematic reviews confused with
    meta-analyses. You'd only conduct a meta-analysis in the context of
    a systematic review, but they're not exactly synonymous. [Here's a
    quick overview of the
    difference](https://guides.lib.odu.edu/c.php?g=966167&p=7021863).)
-   **Rapid literature reviews** aim to provide robust and reliable
    information, while omitting or streamlining certain components of
    the review to save time. They typically take 2 to 6 months to
    complete with 2 researchers reviewing materials.¬†
-   **Scoping literature reviews** assess the scope and nature of
    existing research *prior* to a more rigorous review or study. They
    can take anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks with 1 or 2 researchers working
    on the review. Scoping reviews are often used to map the available
    evidence as preparation for a more extensive review.¬†
-   **Traditional (narrative) literature reviews** are a focused and
    objective analysis of the existing evidence, usually narrower in
    scope than a systematic review. Often, narrative reviews include
    commentary from the researcher, expressing their opinion about the
    topic. This kind of lit review can take 1 to 4 weeks to complete and
    usually only require a single researcher.¬†

‚Äç

![Types of literature
reviews](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/62ea88045f1a0b1b00c4d0c7_iFf_PFtoM_fhkzRj6GLlaY35858EuwtiwU45MgNxPaG2M8zjZUT6geFdavauU1j2cjA_uGLPTc_DzbMqA-_FZzBCGV1ogxAWyxxYEkIu-yWy9NJ-_FeGSbTAgsgSI8Y_YrLdZCz2N4HGQh9m5JOxSHc.png)

‚Äç

üí° In the context of UX research---where time and resources are often
limited---you'll typically conduct **scoping** or **traditional**
literature reviews.¬†

‚Äç

What's the purpose of a literature review, anyway?¬†
---------------------------------------------------

\
Literature reviews are extensive audits of the existing research on a
particular topic---but why are literature reviews important?

‚Äç

As Samantha Silver says in her article for [Key Lime
Interactive](https://info.keylimeinteractive.com/the-value-of-old-school-literature-reviews-for-modern-ux-research):

‚Äç

> "Many folks want to roll their eyes at the idea of having to do a
> 'large book report,' but this discredits the powerful research
> methodology that is the literature review. Spending 6 years in
> academia prior to my time in UX research, I have been able to see a
> tremendous amount of value (and critical need) for the application of
> literature reviews in modern UX research."

‚Äç

The key benefits of lit reviews for UX research include:

-   Minimizing research costs
-   Saving time compared to a form study
-   Quickly getting you up to speed on a particular topic
-   Helping you avoid "rookie mistakes" in follow-up research
-   Showcasing context or highlights gaps in knowledge
-   Justifying or revealing the need for more involved research
-   Improving the overall credibility of future research findings

‚Äç

In other words, literature reviews help you avoid "reinventing the
wheel" when conducting research with limited time and resources,
allowing you to strategically refine, narrow, and kick-start future
projects by building off of what's already known.¬†

‚Äç

üôá Some researchers also value lit reviews as a show of respect for the
researchers who came before them. Unless you're truly blazing a new,
never-before-explored path, any research you conduct will be informed
(and ultimately improved) by drawing on the hard work of others in the
field.

‚Äç

Examples of literature reviews: What does an effective lit review look like?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Quality standards for lit reviews might vary depending on the type and
context of the review, but in general, a good lit review will be:

-   Well-structured (we'll teach you how to structure a lit review later
    in the chapter)
-   Well-written (use clear and concise language)
-   Unbiased (as much as possible, by calling out areas of controversy)
-   Conducted with reliable and relevant sources

‚Äç

Here are some examples of good literature reviews, both from User
Interviews's internal research team and external researchers.¬†

### More literature review examples:

-   [**Mail Surveys and Response Rates: A Literature
    Review**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3151093?searchText=literature%20review&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dliterature%2Breview%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-6490%2Ftest_segment_3&refreqid=fastly-default%3A219620c29a8d2d30ea0f2016c28cc348)**:**
    This literature review, published in *The Journal of Marketing
    Research*, looked at empirical studies concerned with [increasing
    response
    rates](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/improve-your-research-participant-response-rate-with-better-invites)
    to mail surveys. It found that many techniques used for improving
    response rates have little supporting evidence, and that the only
    techniques with evidence for being consistently effective are
    follow-up letters and monetary incentives.¬†
-   [**Psychosocial Work Environment and Mental Health---A Meta-Analytic
    Review**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40967597?searchText=literature%20review&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dliterature%2Breview%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-6490%2Ftest_segment_3&refreqid=fastly-default%3A219620c29a8d2d30ea0f2016c28cc348)**:**
    This systematic literature review, published in *The Scandinavian
    Journal of Work, Environment & Health*, looked at papers concerning
    the relationship between work stressors and mental health. It found
    that high psychological demands, little freedom for decision-making,
    low social support, high job insecurity, and an imbalance between
    effort and reward are all risk factors for common mental disorders.¬†
-   [**Assistive Technology as a Self-Management Tool for Prompting
    Students with Intellectual Disabilities to Initiate and Complete

    This review, published in *Education and Training in Developmental
    Disabilities*, looked at papers concerning technology to help those
    with intellectual disabilities to initiate and complete tasks on
    their own. It found that assistive technology is an effective
    self-management tool for people with intellectual disabilities.¬†

Should you conduct lit reviews before or after a primary research study?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Mostly before---but you might choose to do both, if you're doing
research regularly.¬†

‚Äç

Literature reviews can be performed any time you want to quickly get up
to speed on a particular topic, and many researchers use lit reviews as
a first step in developing their overall [UX research
strategy](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-ux-research-strategy).
As more research is added to the literature over time, you might want to
conduct follow-up lit reviews to stay up to date.¬†

‚Äç

Sometimes, they're included as part of a larger research paper, such as
[ethnographies](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ethnography).
They're ideal for those times when you:¬†

-   Aren't sure which questions you need to ask
-   Don't know if your questions warrant a full study¬†
-   Want to gain a better understanding of the 'known knowns' and 'known
    unknowns' before you dig deeper

‚Äç

Regardless of the circumstances, a lit review will illuminate gaps in
existing knowledge about a topic. Expect a lit review to inspire more
questions than answers, and to bring your needs for future research into
focus.¬†

‚Äç

How to conduct (and write) a good literature review¬†
----------------------------------------------------

### 1. Choose the topic and research question.¬†

\
If you've been reading this Field Guide from the beginning, you're
already familiar with the process of [planning for UX
research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/planning-user-research).¬†

‚Äç

Just like every other research method (and really, most big decisions in
life---like buying a car, getting your master's degree, or taking a
vacation), literature reviews benefit from having [a focused and
intentional
plan](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/create-user-research-plan).¬†

‚Äç

Before you start your lit review, identify:

-   **The topic you're going to focus on** (e.g. Managerial habits in
    enterprise companies)
-   **The** [**research
    questions**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-questions)
    **you're hoping to answer** (e.g. How do managers in enterprise
    companies currently approach their roles and responsibilities? What
    are their primary goals and challenges? Which managerial techniques
    are most effective? What tools do they use to do their jobs?)

‚Äç

Try to keep your topic and research question broad enough to allow for a
thorough,
[discovery](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/discovery-methods)-based
review of the available resources, but narrow enough that you aren't
overwhelmed by the size and scope of the literature.¬†

‚Äç

### 2. Determine the type and scope of the review.

\
As we mentioned earlier, UX researchers will typically focus on
**scoping** or **traditional** literature reviews---but you might
consider other types of lit reviews depending on your research questions
and goals.¬†

‚Äç

No matter what type of review you choose, it's important to clearly
delineate the scope before you begin researching: What is the maximum or
minimum number of sources that your review should include? What is the
maximum or minimum amount of time you should spend on collecting and
analyzing those sources?

‚Äç

Defining your scope ahead of time will help you avoid going down a
rabbit hole and wasting time and effort that would be better spent
elsewhere.¬†

‚Äç

#### How long should a literature review be?¬†

\
As long as it needs to be, and no longer. The exact length will depend
on your topic, audience, and goals---but in the context of UX research,
you probably won't need to write more than a few pages, if that.¬†

‚Äç

### 3. Find internal and external sources.¬†

\
Once you've set a topic and scope, it's time to search the literature.¬†

‚Äç

Your sources will vary depending on what you're researching, but you may
want to look at:

-   **Internal sources** like customer feedback and [user
    interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews),
    research repositories, Slack channels, or other company databases.¬†
-   **External sources** like books, social media, customer reviews on
    third-party websites, Google Scholar, JSTOR, Proquest, etc.
-   **Topic-specific sources.** For example, because most of User
    Interviews's work is in the UX space, our VP of User Research,
    [Roberta
    Dombrowski](https://www.userinterviews.com/yearbook-profiles/roberta-dombrowski),
    often refers to blogs like [Nielsen Norman
    Group](http://www.nngroup.com), [dscout's People
    Nerds](https://dscout.com/people-nerds), [Mind the
    Product](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/), or [UX
    Booth](https://www.uxbooth.com/).¬†

‚Äç

Use a spreadsheet to keep track of your sources and make note of
important sections and terms that you want to come back to during the
analysis stage.¬†

‚Äç

Be sure to record:

-   The author, date, and type of study
-   The research questions
-   The methods used (including mixed methods, [qualitative, or
    quantitative](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/qualitative-vs-quantitative-vs-mixed-methods))
-   The results and conclusions made by the authors
-   Any weaknesses or areas of controversy

‚Äç

Julie Dobre, UX Researcher and Strategist at ICF, recommends keeping
track of sources you choose *not* to use as well, in [her article for
UXBooth](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/quick-lit-reviews-reduce-ux-research-time-and-supercharge-your-design/):¬†

‚Äç

> "If a source lacks valuable information, copy the URL to the bottom of
> your table and provide a short sentence to summarize the article for
> yourself and why you did not extract information from it. Provide a
> code like 'No Info' so you can sort them out. This will allow you to
> capture the full breadth of your research effort. It may also prove
> useful if, as your research develops, you realize that you may have
> overlooked something valuable and you want to reread a source, or if a
> source has very basic information that you later realize may be
> valuable to junior team members. It is also a useful way to keep
> yourself on task."

‚Äç

üí° **Pro tip:** When you find a high-quality source, look through its
cited references for additional relevant sources.¬†¬†

‚Äç

### 4. Record and analyze the data from all sources.

\
Once you've collected a healthy body of literature on your chosen topic,
you can begin exploring the relationships between each source and
identifying key insights and conclusions.

‚Äç

Look for:

-   **Trends and patterns** in the
    [methods](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-types)
    used, conclusions drawn, recency of sources, or other key components
    of each study.
-   **Themes** in the types of questions or ideas that crop up
    throughout the literature.
-   **Debates, conflicts, or disagreements** between sources.¬†
-   **Gaps, weaknesses, or surprises** that need to be addressed.¬†

[Analysis and Synthesis
module](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/research-analysis-synthesis)
of this Field Guide.¬†¬†

‚Äç

### 5. Write a summary of your findings.

\
With your sources collected, cited, and scoured for insights, you're
ready to write up your report. The process for writing literature
reviews is similar to that of [writing
reports](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/research-deliverables-reporting)
for any kind of study.¬†

‚Äç

#### **Here's how to write a literature review:**

\
The typical literature review outline includes an introduction, a
summary of the sources and insights, a discussion of weaknesses, and
recommendations for next steps.¬†

-   **Introduce the topic and provide context:** Why did you conduct
    this review? What were you hoping to learn? What is and isn't
    included in the review?
-   **Summarize the sources and present common themes:** These themes
    and insights can be organized chronologically, thematically,
    methodologically, or theoretically---however you think makes the
    most sense for your topic and the insights you found.
-   **Identify important gaps or biases:** What are the main limitations
    with the research you reviewed? What questions do you still have?
-   **Outline new questions or areas for future research:** Now that
    you've completed your literature review, what's next? How does the
    information you found influence future decisions?

Literature reviews for mixed methods and hybrid research
--------------------------------------------------------

\
As we mentioned earlier, it's not advisable to use lit reviews as a
substitute for primary research. Although lit reviews are typically
quicker and cheaper than primary research studies, the insights (and the
quality of those insights) are limited to whatever can be found in your
sources.¬†

‚Äç

Instead, we recommend using lit reviews to help you narrow down your
questions for primary research. By understanding which questions have
already been answered and what's still uncertain, you can focus your
resources on [more impactful
research](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/how-to-track-the-impact-of-ux-research).¬†

‚Äç

In a nutshell
-------------

\
Literature reviews are not just for *academic* research---they're useful
and valid for research in a business context, too.¬†

‚Äç

The research community is releasing interesting, relevant, and sometimes
groundbreaking information on a daily basis. You can maximize the impact
of your work by paying attention to and building off the work of your
peers.¬†

‚Äç

So before you dive into a month-long [diary
study](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/diary-studies),
[A/B
test](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/a-b-testing),
or [continuous feedback
survey](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/continuous-user-feedback-surveys),
start with a literature review. You just might discover something that
surprises you.¬†

User interviews are one of the most flexible and adaptable
methods---they are powerful tools for uncovering new opportunities and
generating ideas during the discovery phase, complement both qualitative
and quantitative evaluative methods, and can be used in conjunction with
ongoing listening continuous methods to keep up with changing customer
needs and opinions over time.¬†

¬†

In case it wasn't obvious from our name, we're big fans of this method.

What are user interviews?
-------------------------

User interviews (also called in-depth interviews) are 30- to 60-minute
conversations with a single participant, in which a researcher asks
questions about a topic of interest to gain a deeper understanding of
participants' their attitudes, beliefs, desires and experiences.

\

Because interviews are live (either online or in-person), moderators are
able to pick up on and respond to verbal and non-verbal cues, ask
followup questions, and probe into topics more deeply. The candid,
interactive nature of interviews often leads to serendipitous nuggets of
insight that is hard to achieve by other methods.

\

This UX research method is a relatively quick and easy way to collect
qualitative user data, and interviews pair well with just about any
other research method---use them to follow up with usability testers,
understand decisions made during card sorting studies, or flesh out
feedback from ongoing listening surveys.

\

User interviews:

-   Are moderated (live)
-   Can be structured or semi-structured
-   Generate rich, qualitative user data
-   Can produce both attitudinal and behavioral insights

\

### Types of user interviews

‚Äç

#### Generative interviews

**Generative interviews** are the most common type of user
interview---they are the best way to answer the question "what don't I
know?".

\

Like other generative or discovery methods, generative interviews are
used early in the design and development process when you're looking for
opportunities and ideas.¬†

\

But these are not simply brainstorming sessions---interviews are
structured conversations used to gather the information you need to
answer clear, specific, and actionable research questions (even if, at
this stage, your research questions are fairly broad).

\

Note that this chapter is primarily focused on generative interviews.

\

#### Contextual interviews

**Contextual interviews** (or **contextual inquiry**) are a special type
of semi-structured interview that gives researchers insight into the
context of use. These interviews take place in a user's environment (in
*context*), which can make them feel more natural than interviews
conducted in a lab or a staged virtual setting.

\

During contextual interviews, researchers ask participants questions
while they complete tasks. This could involve shadowing a participant in
their physical workplace, or moderating a usability testing session and
asking questions as users interact with a site.

\

#### Continuous interviews

**Continuous interviews** are interviews you do on a regular basis by
setting aside a chunk of time each week to connect with users. The goal
of continuous interviewing is to keep you in touch with the people that
matter most---[your
customers](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-doing-kickass-customer-interviews).¬†

\

Continuous interviews are especially important for people who may not
have regular research contact with users. They can also be used to keep
teams in touch with users in between research projects. [Teresa
Torres](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/how-to-interview-customers-continuously-with-teresa-torres-of-product-talk),
who teaches a course on continuous interviewing, explains:\

> The value of continuous interviewing is really just being reminded on
> a regular basis that our customers will always know their world better
> than we possibly could.\

One thing to keep in mind is that the feedback you get from continuous
interviewing may be a bit more scattered than feedback from other, more
focused research.

‚Äç

Our [Continuous User Interview Launch
Kit](https://www.userinterviews.com/launch-kit/continuous-user-interview)
includes an analysis template that will help keep track of the notes you
take during sessions and scan through them quickly to find emerging
themes. These themes can help influence more focused research, or serve
to add color to your existing roadmap.

### What decisions do user interviews enable?

User interviews are used to inform vision decisions, allowing you to get
clarity on a participant\'s big-picture beliefs and philosophies in
order to determine a potential company, product, or service direction.

\

They can also be used to inform strategic decisions, allowing you to
understand participants\' current behaviors, expectations, or
frustrations to determine a plan for a product or service.

\

### What are the outputs?

Interviews generate a large amount of qualitative data, including
detailed notes, transcripts, and videos. All of this data then needs to
be synthesized into artifacts such as: personas, scenarios, thinking
styles, or journey maps.

\

Because interviews capture the voice of the participant, they often
provide powerful first-hand testimonials that support research-backed
recommendations for improvement or change.

\

\

When to choose interviews
-------------------------

User interviews, as we mentioned, can be used throughout the product
development cycle---from ideation to testing to post-launch listening.¬†

\

**Interviews are used:¬†**

-   During initial discovery (before you have a product to test) to
    uncover broad patterns and themes relating to people's¬† experiences,
    problems, behavior, and opinions.
-   To test concepts and early ideas for possible solutions, before
    heavy design work gets underway.
-   As a followup to usability tests or other evaluative methods, when
    it's important for you to have users articulate their decisions or
    experiences.
-   After a product has launched, as a means of understanding evolving
    customer needs and expectations.

### Why are user interviews so important?

We've mentioned contextual and continuous interviews, and have also
explained how interviews can be used alongside methods during the
testing and validation phase.¬†

\

But the truth is user interviews *really* shine during discovery, when
you still don't really know exactly the problem you're trying to solve
or how. You might have a general idea about what a problem is, in which
case generative interviews can help you refine your understanding. Or,
you may simply want to develop a product in a given space, and you need
to generate ideas about what problems exist before you can imagine their
solutions.¬†

\

Generative interviews are a fantastic method for uncovering
opportunities for innovation and illuminating solutions to problems. And
what's more, this method allows you to build up a nice bed of rich
information about your user base from which you can pull ideas---both
for brand new project builds or improvements to existing products.

### Limitations and potential pitfalls of user interviews

Interviews, like every user research method, have their limitations and
drawbacks. None of the potential pitfalls are big enough to outweigh the
benefits, and most can be offset with mindful research design and
planning.

\

Some things to be aware of:\

-   Interview data is largely self-reported. Although researchers can
    record observations about nonverbal responses and make inferences,
    the bulk of interview data comes straight from the participants'
    mouths. And participants, like all humans, are flawed and prone to
    misremember facts and experiences.¬†
-   Participants may leave out important information because they take
    it for granted that the interviewer already knows or is not
    interested in the minor details.¬†
-   Not every participant will share the same amount of information or
    be as forthcoming about their thoughts, feelings, and personal
    experiences. Some people are just more private or shy than others.
-   Interviewing takes practice and skill. From writing effective,
    non-leading interview questions to moderating (but not leading) a
    conversation to qualitative analysis---a lot rests on the abilities
    and preparedness of the researcher\
    \

User interviews can help you answer just about any qualitative research
question you can think of. Qualitative means it\'s answered with words,
not numbers. So while user interviews can\'t tell you how many people
bought your competitor's product, they can help you understand why
people made that purchasing decision.¬†

\

Typically, user interviews are just one piece of your research puzzle.
For most projects, you'll want to supplement interview data with
quantitative methods like product analytics, usability tests, or
surveys.

How to plan and conduct user interviews
---------------------------------------

We covered how to set research goals and come up with effective research
questions in depth in the [Planning UX Research
module](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/planning-user-research)---definitely
give the chapters in that module a read if you're struggling to clarify
your goals or uncover stakeholder needs.¬†Very briefly...

\

### Define your research goals

**Talk to your stakeholders.** Conduct stakeholder interviews to find
out what it is they want to learn, what decisions they need to make, and
what they hope to achieve. You won't be able to satisfy every
stakeholder wish in one research project---look for the core, concrete
goals that can practically be answered through UX research.

\

**Ask yourself** **(and your stakeholders) the following questions**:

1.  What do I want to know?¬†
2.  How will I know when I've learned it?¬†
3.  What company goals will this work support?¬†
4.  What decisions will this research enable?¬†

\

From there, you should be able to answer the key question: *What do I
want to learn through user research?*

\

User interviews, like all the research methods discussed in this Field
Guide, should start with a research question that is **specific** enough
to know when you\'ve found the answer, **actionable** in that you can do
something about it, or **practical** in that you can reasonably answer
it within the scope of a research project.¬†

\

For example, you can\'t reasonably answer \"Why don\'t people buy my
product?\" There could be many different reasons people aren\'t buying
your product, and covering them all in one study wouldn\'t be practical
or give you actionable results.

‚Äç

A better question may be, \"Does my pricing page accurately answer my
users questions?\", or \"Why do people in my target market choose X
competitor over my product?\".¬†

\

Both of these questions could be answered with user interviews, and your
team would have a clear path to action once the study was complete.

\

How to write an interview guide
-------------------------------

Next, prepare a set of questions to ask participants. Having a list of
questions helps keep the conversation flowing and serves as a good
framework for notetaking and organizing data during and after the
interview.

\

Some of these interview questions should spring directly from your core
research question.¬†

\

For example, if you want to learn how people research travel
destinations, you could plan to say "Tell me about your last vacation"
followed by the question "What prompted you to choose X as a
destination?"

\

But remember: This is an interview, not an interrogation---a good
moderator guide should also incorporate get-to-know-you questions, and
leave room for spontaneous, open-ended responses and followup
questions.¬†

### Tips for writing user interview questions

-   **Ask questions that focus on past behavior vs. hypothetical
    scenarios.** "What would you do if..." can be a useful question, but
    in many cases, it's not as useful as "How did you handle it
    when...". It's a golden rule in job interviews, too: past behavior
    is the best indication of future behavior. So begin in real life
    scenarios where the subject has prior experience.
-   **Ask open-ended questions.** Give your participants the opportunity
    to elaborate on their answers and take the conversation in new and
    interesting directions. Questions like "What is your opinion on
    Neoclassical architecture?" are much more likely to produce
    unexpected insights than closed questions such as "Do you agree that
    people built far too many dang columns between the late 18th-mid
    20th century?" (That is also a leading question, which makes it
    doubly bad.)¬†
-   **Mitigate your own biases and presumptions.** Generative interviews
    can be glorious in how they meander and illuminate areas you might
    not have even considered. Still, generative interviews can suffer
    from interviewer assumptions or bias. To keep yourself accountable
    for your own presumptions and preconceived ideas, try to keep
    questions open-ended and aligned around words like how, why, and
    what. This will guide your interviewee toward their own answers,
    rather than leading or prompting them toward the areas where you
    want or expect them to go.
-   **Be willing to have your assumptions challenged.** It helps to come
    in with some idea of what you think is true, but generative
    interviews are only useful if you allow ideas to be generated. So
    don't be overly attached to the rightness or wrongness of your
    preconceptions.¬†
-   **Create a list of possible followup questions.** Anticipate
    different responses to your key questions, and make a list of
    possible followup questions that will help you dig deeper and steer
    the conversation down interesting avenues. It can also be useful to
    think about how you'd keep the conversation flowing if a participant
    didn't have an answer to your question at all.
-   **Be prepared for different conversation styles and personalities.**
    Some participants will talk your ear off---others might need to be
    asked several followup questions to elicit the same amount of
    information. Identify your most important interview questions (the
    must haves) to keep talkative participants focused. To account for
    the reticent types, make sure you've prepared more questions than
    you think you'll have time to ask.
-   **Avoid leading questions.** Leading questions prime the participant
    to answer in a certain way by suggesting a 'correct' response. A
    (glaringly, obviously) leading question would be something like "Why
    do you love sugary food so much?" Less obviously, "What is your
    biggest dietary challenge?" could also be considered leading
    question as it assumes a negative relationship with food, which may
    not be true for all participants.

### Moderator guide vs. script

We purposely this set of questions a 'discussion guide' or 'moderator
guide', rather than a 'script'.

\

That's because although its good to prepare a loose questionnaire to
guide the interview, you should feel free to deviate from it when it
makes sense. You don't want the interview to feel stilted---you want it
to flow, and you want your interviewee comfortable. If the interview is
taking a useful turn, follow it where it wants to go.¬†

\

For discovery interviews, where the scope of your inquiry might be quite
broad, consider a list of topics in lieu of a questionnaire.¬†

\

If you identify a handful (3-6) of larger topics you'd like to cover,
and identify a handful of subtopic, you've got yourself a nice loose
guideline for an interview that won't be overly confining.¬†

\

For example, say your area of interest is snacks (because who isn't
interested in snacks?). You might come up with larger topics like
cookies, popcorn, charcuterie, and healthy snacks. And beneath each main
topic, you might have a few subtopics. In the end, your list of topics
might look like\...\

-   Cookies: gooey, crunchy, layered
-   Popcorn: instant, savory, sweet
-   Antipasto: meats, cheeses, olives, nuts
-   Fruits: fresh fruit, dried fruit, pureed fruit

\

And you can use this list of presumptions as a guideline for
understanding how, why, and what your interviewee looks for in a snack
without locking yourself into a prescribed list of questions.

### Examples of good user interview questions

We put together a list of sample interview questions in [this handy
sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LSuiFwi30MVl7msbAnB8kZoAf25Zr6jW3Zt4-ug9McI/edit?usp=sharing).
Here are a few examples of different types of interview questions you
can ask:

\

**Getting-to-know-you questions**

-   Tell me about your role at work
-   What did you do last weekend?

\

**Digging in questions**

-   When was the last time you did \[activity\]?¬†
-   Tell me about how you currently solve \[problem\].

\

**Product/market fit questions**

-   Have you used any other tools in the past to solve \[problem\]?
-   What\'s your team\'s current budget for \[activity\]?

\

**Usability testing questions**

-   Please describe your experience with \[tool\].
-   If you were looking for \[information\] where would you expect to
    find it?

\

[**Customer
interview**](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-doing-kickass-customer-interviews)
**questions**

-   Tell me about how you and/or your team uses our product.
-   What do you wish our product could do that it can\'t today?

How to recruit participants for interviews
------------------------------------------

Researching with humans does, unfortunately, involve some (sometimes
tedious) administrative work---like creating an interview schedule,
collecting signatures, and plenty of emails--- to make sure everything
runs smoothly.¬†

\

Thankfully, there are ways to streamline the process, which we've shared
below. But first, it's time to:

### Decide who to interview

Take another look at your research question and ask yourself: *Who is
likely to have the answers I'm looking for?* Do the same with your most
important interview questions.

\

Write down the qualities you think that person---this knowledgeable
answer-giver you're picturing---is likely to have. This list is the
beginning of your participant profile, which you will use to write your
[**screener
survey**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/screener-surveys).

\

We say beginning, because it's likely that your list is too long, the
profile too narrow. Really scrutinize each of the qualities you wrote
down---does a participant *have* to be vegetarian or Black or married or
live in Southern California in order to provide valuable insights to
your question?¬†

\

Unless it's truly necessary for a participant to fall within a certain
demographic, you can probably strike that criteria from your list. When
we filter by demographics, we're often making assumptions about
relationships between people's backgrounds and their behaviors---and
doing so risks biasing your research and missing out on diverse
perspectives.

\

We wrote an entire module about [finding and recruiting the right
participants](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/find-good-research-participants),
creating [screener
surveys](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/screener-surveys),
and [UX research
incentives](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ux-research-incentives)---which
is why we aren't diving deep into the details here.¬†

\

Read the chapters on [UX Research
Recruiting](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/recruiting)for
a step-by-step guide to user research recruitment, plus in-depth advice
on filtering participants and calculating rewards.

### How many people do you need to interview?

There is something of an art to deciding how many people to interview.
In general, the more people you talk to, the more information you will
get---but only up to a point. The amount of fresh insights you'll glean
on a topic diminishes with each subsequent interview. Eventually (often
sooner than you think), the responses will start to get repetitive.¬†

\

That's why it's good to start small. **For most interview studies, you
only need 5 participants.**

\

So start by recruiting 5 people, since you are almost certain to need
that many. You can always recruit more folks later based on your needs:¬†

-   Consider how much information you need; the more complex the
    situation you are investigating, and the less you know about it to
    begin with, the more people you will need to talk to. Depending on
    complexity, you might plan to recruit 6 to 10 participants.
-   Consider important subgroups in your pool of potential interviewees
    (for example, if you need to talk to members of multiple age
    groups). In that case, you might want to recruit 3-5 people from
    each subgroup, so multiply accordingly.
-   If you have not conducted open-ended interviews before, or have not
    done any recently, add two or three extra interviews to your list
    for practice---if everything goes well, you'll even have some extra
    data.¬†

\

Remember that when you're doing discovery research, it's good to keep an
open mind and have a flexible research plan. You can plan and budget for
any number of participants, but that doesn't mean you have to recruit
them all at once. Generative interviews can sometimes generate ideas
about who you should interview next. So if one interview leads you down
an unexpected (but relevant path), follow it.¬†

\

Recruiting participants for interviews can be fast (really)---which
means you can respond to new lines of inquiry as they crop up.¬†

\
### Create an interviewing schedule

User interviews can be as long or as short as you need them to be, but
we typically find that 30-45 minutes is the right amount of time for
each session. That gives you enough time to spend a few minutes at the
beginning warming up and getting comfortable, and to wrap up. It\'s also
short enough that interviews don't feel like an unmanageable time
commitment from you or the participant.

\

Of course, if you feel like doing a 15-minute, 20-minute, or even
hour-long user interview, that\'s perfectly ok too!¬†

### Obtain consent

Don't collect data without permission. Before the day of the interview
and at the beginning of the session, clearly explain why you're
conducting the interview, how the data will be used, and how it will be
stored. Get every participants' *informed* consent in writing---these
forms, and your verbal explanation, should be in plain,
easy-to-understand language.

\

And remember: Your interviews may involve collecting sensitive or
personal information, in which case you will have to take steps to
either safeguard or destroy all such information.¬†

### Communicate with participants

To help your participants remember the interview date and get to the
right place at the right time, send them an email with the following key
pieces of information:

-   Time and date---if doing remote research, make sure you give the
    time and date in your participant's time zone.
-   Location---include a map and directions if the test is in person, or
    a link to a video call and instructions for joining.
-   Research topic---don't give too much information away, but do remind
    users what the research will be about.

\

Plan to follow up multiple times for interviews scheduled a week or more
in advance. And when conducting remote interviews, never assume that a
participant has or knows how to use a platform---give them clear
instructions on how to join the call in the emails leading up to the
interview.

##### Tips for conducting [remote user interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/tools-for-remote-user-interviews):

###### ‚Ä¢ Send participants instructions on how to join ahead of time, especially if they'll need to download software to participate. ‚Äç ‚Ä¢ If you don't get confirmation from a participant, send them a reminder and include that software/dial in information again. This will save you time and heartache! Product plug: you can easily do this through bulk messaging in User Interviews.¬† ‚Äç ‚Ä¢ If you're showing a prototype or doing a usability test, test the test first. Ask a colleague to run through it with you or, at the very least, trial it yourself. ‚Äç ‚Ä¢ Be kind and patient, especially with folks who may be stressed during this time and/or unfamiliar with the tools you're using to conduct your interviews. ‚Äç ‚Ä¢ Maintain eye contact. Get a notetaker and/or record and transcribe the interview so you can focus on your participant, not your keyboard.¬†

How to moderate a user interview
--------------------------------

It's here: Interview day! Kicking off a user interview study is always a
bit nerve-wracking---but a little practice and preparation go a long
way. Whether this is your first user interview or your 100th, we promise
you'll get into the groove.

### Testing, testing, 1-2-3

To make sure everything goes off without a hitch, always test your tech.
Do a test run of the software you'll be using, make sure it\'s
up-to-date, triple-check your internet connection, and charge your
devices.

\

We recommend clearing your workspace as much as possible to help you
focus on the interviewee. Tidy up your desk, close some of those browser
tabs, and make sure any materials you'll be asking participants to
interact with or respond to---files, images, websites, a physical
prototype, etc---are organized and close at hand.

\

Once you have everything in order, it's time to conduct your interview!

### Be friendly, personable, professional.¬†

Begin by introducing yourself. Briefly explain the reason for the
interview and how long you expect it to take---your interviewee may
already know all of this from your prior communications, but always
recap on the day itself.¬†

\

Make the participant feel comfortable. Create a rapport, assure them
that there are no right or wrong answers, and get them warmed up with
some get-to-know-you small talk. Remember, this is about establishing
trust, not becoming BFFs---focus on making sure they feel safe and
seen.¬†

\

Talk slowly. Pause. Ask them if they have any questions of their own
before you begin.

### Start with the easy, general questions¬†

Start with questions that are easy to answer and contain no judgements
or assumptions. Work toward more specific questions gradually, and save
deeper probing about personal details and behaviors for later in the
interview, once the participant has started to open up and feel at ease.

\

For instance, if you are interviewing [public school teachers who have
to purchase classroom
supplies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/teachers-school-supplies.html)
with their own money, you might work toward the specifics by asking
them:

1.  Tell me about \[town/city in which they teach.
2.  Can you describe your school for me?
3.  What does your classroom look like?
4.  Can you tell me about the decorations in your classroom? Where did
    those come from?
5.  What about supplies like pencils, markets, craft paper?
6.  For the items that you purchased, with your own funds, what made you
    decide to buy those items in particular?

### Ask clarifying followup questions

[Play
dumb.](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/7-tips-for-better-user-interviews)
Don't be shy about asking questions that seem obvious, or that you think
you know the answer to. For instance, if someone says "I really hate
wine" you might ask them "what do you mean by that?" They might then go
on to say "I mean I don't like that it gives me headaches. I actually
used to love drinking red wine with dinner, but it's not worth the
agonizing hangovers."¬†

\

In another example, if someone from Boston is talking about their habits
and says "I go to Harvard often," ask them to clarify if they mean
Harvard Square, the metro stop, or the university---or something else
entirely.¬†

\

You can also ask people to perform tasks by sharing their screen, or by
describing the action: "Can you show/describe to me how you \[X\]?"¬†

\

User Researcher [Nikki
Anderson](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-a-generative-interview-guide-270faa46dbbc)
shared that she frames interview questions using the Taxonomy of
Cognitive Domain, which explains how certain verbs can trigger
particular thought processes:

\

### Get comfortable with awkward silences

Don't rush the participant. Once they finish speaking, let their
response hang in the air for several seconds longer than feels
comfortable (try counting to 5 in your head before replying).
Eventually, many participants will fill that silence themselves by
expanding on their response. If they don't, you know you've given them
enough time to answer thoroughly and can move on.¬†

\

### Keep things on track

Some people have a lot to say. Digressions or apparently excessive
storytelling can be great opportunities to learn things you didn\'t
think to ask about, and allowing some digression is good for rapport,
but be prepared to diplomatically pivot back on topic when necessary. Do
not let an interview go into overtime, since your interviewee has places
to be---as do you. You can always schedule a follow-up if need be.

### Wrap it up

As you approach the end of a session, preface your final questions with
a statement like"I just have one more question before we wrap up," or
"To wind things down, I have just one or two more questions." This will
make the end more gentle, especially if you have someone really pouring
their heart out.

\

Make sure to reserve time at the end of the interview to sincerely thank
your participants for their time, vulnerability, and contribution to
your project. Before you close the book, ask participants if they have
any questions or anything else to add ("Is there anything I didn't ask
about that you think I should have?").

\

[UX Researcher St√©phanie Walter
says](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/a-cheatsheet-for-user-interview-and-follow-ups-questions/)
of this final question:\

> "Most of the people will say no. So I wait. Then they think a little
> bit and actually have things to add. So here again, don't
> underestimate the power of silence, don't turn the recorder off. A lot
> of people will give you interesting feedback once the interview is
> "finished".

\

How to record insights and take great notes
-------------------------------------------

We recommend bringing someone else on your team along to [take notes
during the interview
session](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/why-you-really-need-a-notetaker-for-moderated-research-sessions)
so you can focus on the conversation and stay attuned to nonverbal cues
and opportunities for insightful follow up questions. This is especially
true if you're conducting interviews in-person, but even recorded remote
interviews can benefit from having a skilled notetaker in the copilot
seat.

\

And even if you're relying on recordings, it's always a good idea to
take time after a session to write down thoughts and impressions and add
those notes to the transcripts.¬†

\

Note taking can be descriptive---describing something you saw or
heard--- or evaluative---making a judgement or inference based on
something you saw or heard. If you can, include timestamps with your
notes for context.

\

You can take notes with pen and paper, in a whiteboard tool like Miro,
with a dedicated research tool, spreadsheets---whatever works.¬†

\

In our [User Interview Launch
Kit](https://www.userinterviews.com/launch-kit/user-interview), we've
included a Google Sheets note-taking template that makes it easy to take
quick and organized notes during an interview session. It also makes it
easy to pull out specific answers and tidbits from each interview.¬†

‚Äç

**üöÄ Get the** [**User Interview Launch
Kit.**](https://www.userinterviews.com/launch-kit/user-interview)

\
And whenever possible, record your interviews. Not only will
[transcription
tools](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/user-research-recordings-analysis)
make your life a whole lot easier in the next step, but you'll be able
to pull out impactful audio or video snippets to share with
stakeholders. Just be sure that you notify the participant before
recording begins and obtain their consent.\

How to analyze user interview data
----------------------------------

Transcriptions and audio/video recordings are powerful tools for
capturing and sharing verbatim records of the sessions, but it's up to
you, as the researcher, to make sense of those records.

\

You can save yourself a lot of work at the end of a project by forming
good note taking habits and transcribing and tagging data as you go.

\

For every interview:

-   Transcribe audio and video recordings
-   Convert shorthand notes into full, clear sentences
-   Organize and contextualize any notes that were jotted down¬†
-   Use **qualitative coding** to tag and categorize your data

\

Some study designs even call for giving interviewees a chance to review
the transcripts, notes, and initial analysis, in case they have any
corrections or retractions. Place all your records, including copies of
the recordings or field notes and any amendments offered by the
interviewee, together for easy later retrieval.

### Synthesize and organize insights

It is easy to get lost in the sheer amount of information that
qualitative methods like user interviews can generate. Keep your
analysis focused by answering your research questions first and
foremost. Don't ask the data questions if you don't have a plan or use
for the answers. (But that doesn't mean you can't revisit the data later
and analyze it with a different research question in mind! Properly
tagged and stored, interview data is a rich edition to your research
repository.)

\

For most interview analysis and synthesis, **Google Sheets** (or your
preferred spreadsheet tool) is all you need. We also recommend using a
tool like **Miro**, **MURAL**, or **Figjam** to organize your notes and
make sense of emerging themes in the data.

\

Roberta Dombrowski, our VP of User Research, typically conducts
interview analysis in two stages: first looking at each session in
isolation, and then looking for patterns across interviews.¬†

\

### Share snippets and insights¬†

User interviews produce audio and video recordings that are full of
rich, first-person accounts of the user experience. Include audio/video
clips in your findings to bring a human voice/face to the data. If
you're sharing interview snippets as you go, be sure your stakeholders
understand that the clips don't necessarily reflect trends across
participants (since you haven't done the final analysis).¬†

\

Mind maps, word clouds, and storyboards are other effective ways to
share interview data with stakeholders who don't have the time or
patience to mine through spreadsheets or large data sets.

\

##### **How we synthesize user interview data at User Interviews**

###### Here\'s how Roberta, VP of User Research at User Interviews [analyzes and shares interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/ux-research-presentations-reports-templates-examples): 

###### ‚Ä¢ After each user interview, Roberta create a snapshot of the interview in Miro.¬† ‚Äç ‚Ä¢ She shares the snapshot and key takeaways in a project Slack channel to give stakeholders visibility as the study progresses. ‚Äç ‚Ä¢ After all the interviews have wrapped up, Roberta does a "final synthesis" using the takeaways she put together along the way.¬† ‚Äç ‚Ä¢ This synthesis can be shared with stakeholders (and the wider company) as a slide deck, a written summary, or both.¬†

UX interview tools and logistics
--------------------------------

One of the reasons user interviews are such a popular method is that
they are economical. You don't need a lot of time, budget, or special
tools to conduct successful interviews.¬†

‚Äç

[üßô‚ú® Discover more tools in the 2022 UX Research Tools
Map](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-tools-map-2022), a
fantastical guide to the UXR software landscape.

\

To conduct user interviews, whether in-person or remotely, you'll need:

\

#### Research recruiting tools

[**User Interviews**](https://www.userinterviews.com/recruit) has a pool
of [over 700,000 vetted
participants](https://www.userinterviews.com/recruit?source=navbarRecruitResearcher)
and customizable filters to help you find exactly the people you're
looking for. You typically only need 5 participants to start with---and
when you sign up, your [first three
participants](https://www.userinterviews.com/recruit) are on us.¬†

\

#### Video conferencing tools or a quiet venue

Next, you'll need a way to talk to people. For in-person interviews,
this means a venue that allows for quiet, private conversation. This
could be your office, their office, a lab, a rented workspace, etc. Be
sure to factor travel expenses and refreshments into the cost of your
budget for in-person interviews.

\

Remote user interviews are simpler---you and your participant will just
need a video conferencing link and a computer or smartphone. Tools like
**Zoom**, **Microsoft Teams**, and **Google Meet** have become so
ubiquitous that most (though not all!) users will feel comfortable using
these platforms for a call. Even still, try to choose software that will
be familiar to people and always provide clear, step-by-step
instructions ahead of time.¬†

\

#### Tools for recording sessions and data

If you're using a tool like Zoom to conduct your interview, recording
the session is simple---and you can easily download a transcript of the
conversation, which you can then use for analysis.¬†

\

To record in-person interviews, you may be able to get by with a
smartphone, or you might need special audio/video equipment. Always
test-drive your setup ahead of time to make sure the sound is clear and
(if applicable) the video offers an unobstructed view of the
participant.¬†

\

During the interview, you'll need a tool for taking notes.¬† A good
old-fashioned notepad and pen can work but remember you'll need to
transcribe your notes later for analysis. We recommend that you:

-   Have a team member sit in and record observations and participant
    responses in a word document or spreadsheet (like the one in the
    [User Interview Launch
    Kit](https://www.userinterviews.com/launch-kit/user-interview))
-   And/or a tool like [**Grain**](https://grain.co),
    [**Otter.ai**](https://otter.ai), or [**Perfect
    Recall**](https://www.perfectrecall.app) that create transcriptions,
    enable contextual notetaking, and let you highlight important
    snippets¬†

\

#### Qualitative research analysis tools

Finally, you'll need a way to analyze your data. If you're just getting
started with user research, you won't need anything fancier than a
spreadsheet (like the one in the [User Interview Launch
Kit](https://www.userinterviews.com/launch-kit/user-interview)) and
maybe a whiteboard tool like
[**Miro**](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/collaborative-ux-research-miro)
for organizing and synthesizing data.¬†

\

If you're planning to conduct a lot of in-depth interviews, you may want
to invest in a research repository tool that offers built-in analysis
such as
[**Aurelius**](https://www.aureliuslab.com/user-research-synthesis-and-analysis),
[**Dovetail**](https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-data-analysis/)
, or [**Optimal

Hybrid research: Combining interviews with other methods¬†
---------------------------------------------------------

Interviews are [like the
capybaras](https://www.boredpanda.com/capybara-unusual-animal-friendship/)
of user research methods---they play nice with almost everything.

\

They can be combined with other methods, such as observational field
studies or focus groups. An initial series of interviews can lay the
groundwork for a field study, or an observational field study can
develop insights that are later used in planning an interview series.
Participant-observer studies often include interviews.

\

The same recruitment methods, tools, and logistical planning---and
sometimes even the same interviewees---can be used in both the
generative and evaluative phases of a project. In the generative stage,
you might pick their brains regarding the pain points of using a certain
product, and later ask them to use the product to determine whether
those problems have been resolved.

\

Our favorite user research method
---------------------------------

User Interviews (the company) owes a lot to user interviews (the
method). Our founders conducted generative user interviews as part of
the discovery process that led them to found the company. You can read
all about how we went from being a failed startup to raising a \$10M
Series A with (meta) user research in [our origin
story](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/from-failure-to-a-venture-backed-startup-through-meta-user-research).

‚Äç

But don\'t take our word for it. Get out there, conduct some interviews,
and see for yourself how powerful user insights can be!

Margaret Mead, the world-renowned anthropologist, famously said: \"What
people say, what people do, and what people say they do are entirely
different things.\"

‚Äç

We have alarming blind spots when it comes to describing and explaining
our own behavior. In trying to recall what we did or believe we did, our
recollections will often not align with, say, a video of the incident we
tried to describe. And the motivations that drive our behavior aren't
always clear to us, either.¬†

‚Äç

This is largely why ethnography was born. By bringing researchers into
the 'field'---or the real-life environment of the subject---ethnographic
research serves to fill these blind spots to better understand people's
needs.¬†

‚Äç

Although ethnography has its roots in anthropology, ethnographic methods
have been adapted for use in user research and product development,
which is what we'll focus on in this chapter.¬†

What is ethnography?
--------------------

Ethnography is a type of field study in which researchers observe people
in their natural environments in order to gain a more holistic,
contextual understanding of their needs. Unlike[**other types of field
studies**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-academy-lesson/field-studies),
ethnography requires the researcher to immerse themselves in the
environment they're studying.¬†

‚Äç

In ethnographic field studies, the researcher might become friendly with
their subjects, and work alongside them socially throughout the study.
This is especially useful when the researcher's natural or known
environment is very different from the one they've set out to study.

### Types of ethnography

### Ethnography in UX research

In the context of UX design, ethnography is sometimes referred to as
**digital anthropology**, **field research**, or **contextual
inquiry**.¬†

‚Äç

Ethnographic UX research reveals user insights by allowing you to
observe users in the context of their real-life technical and social
environments.

Benefits of ethnography in UX research and design
-------------------------------------------------

The benefits of ethnography in UX research and design include:¬†

-   **Natural, real world settings to observe natural, real world
    behaviors.** An ethnographic approach to research in UX design and
    technology looks at how people relate to tech in their natural
    settings. Through ethnographics, designers are able to learn about
    the daily lives of their potential users and their natural
    tendencies and behavior patterns as they unfold.
-   ‚Äç**Repeated exposure to examples.** In a survey or interview or even
    a focus group, you get to tap user insights on a single occasion (or
    maybe a handful of occasions, but they're isolated and curated).
    Ethnography is ongoing. Research happens continuously throughout the
    length of a study.
-   **Provides context.** Ethnography allows researchers to observe the
    situations and circumstances in which a product will be used. Some
    circumstances are obviously important---for example, how quickly are
    users able to retrieve and open their umbrella when it starts to
    rain?---but there are subtle moments that can provide further
    insights as well. At what point do users reach for their
    umbrella---after the first thunder, or earlier? At what point
    between mist and downpour do people make the hood-to-umbrella
    changeover? And so on.¬†
-   **Really get to know your end user.** Imagine an engineer from
    sparsely-populated Havre, Montana trying to develop a product for
    the light rail system in congested Baltimore, Maryland. Without
    ethnographic research, that engineer likely wouldn't know where to
    begin. By observing the target audience firsthand and developing
    insights based on real behavior, the engineer can build a product
    that's better suited to the needs of future users.¬†
-   **Understand pain points, gaps, and opportunities.** Ethnographic
    studies tap into the social aspect of product design by revealing
    the challenges people deal with as they interact with their
    environments or existing tools. Researchers observe behavioral cues
    to discover where technology might help (or where it could be
    interfering), and it ultimately informs better, more effective
    product design.¬†

### Examples of ethnographic studies

#### Parking study

A real-life example is[**an ethnographic study on
parking**](http://www.izix.com/pubs/Isaacs-Parking-EPIC2011.pdf) from
Ellen Isaacs and her team at the Palo Alto Research Center. They studied
things like how people searched for parking, how intuitive parking signs
were, and how easy signage was to read as they drove past. They used
their findings to understand what might make parking better and inform
the design of new parking systems.

‚Äç

#### Photocopier study

[**This fun video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV0jY5VgymI&t=203s)
shows two world renowned computer scientists trying to understand a
basic copy machine... and failing to do so, which gives insight into how
and where copiers can be made more intuitive.

\

##### **UXR Case Study: How IDEO Collected Emotional Data Through Ethnography**‚Äç

###### Storytelling is the foundation of human relationships. But often, people are guarded and will hold back their perspectives in a research setting. This phenomenon is known as the[**Hawthorne Effect**](http://www.economist.com/node/12510632): people are likely to change their behavior if they know they are being observed. ‚Äç One way that [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/), a global design and innovation company, counteracts this challenge---and gets people to open up---is by diverging from traditional Q&A-style interviews. Often, these are situations that necessitate a change in communication dynamics. In these situations, IDEO takes a remixed approach to interception-based recruiting. ‚Äç In 2014, the company partnered with Mercy Corps to provide support to Typhoon Haiyan survivors in the Philippines. The communities most at-risk were low-income, rural, and without banks. The company's goal was to understand how people could rebuild their livelihoods---how to obtain funds to restart businesses that communities had lost. ‚Äç In addition to conducting interviews, IDEO built an interactive board game: ‚Äç "We watched closely to observe people's body language, and asked what the player thought and felt about the results," explains the IDEO team. "By designing a visually compelling way to more deeply engage with the people we're designing for, we had greater access to stories of how rural people felt about banks and the financial products available to them. We learned that because many had unsteady cash flows, they were afraid to take loans they may not be able to pay back." ‚Äç By the end of the game, IDEO identified which aspects of a financial product sparked excitement or fear, to understand their emotional relationship with the product. The stories helped IDEO.org create a financial product that served the needs of the region. 

When to use ethnography in product development¬†
-----------------------------------------------

The short answer: Early on.¬†

‚Äç

Although ethnography could be applied to learn how to make a product
better, it's more commonly used to decide what product to build in the
first place. In the earliest stages of a product's development,
researchers use ethnography to explore concepts for new products, find
business opportunities, and discover what sorts of tech products people
might want.

How to conduct ethnographic user research
-----------------------------------------

There are two main phases of conducting an ethnographic field study: the
preliminary planning period and the part that involves working with
participants.

### Designing ethnographic research studies

While potentially open-ended, a field study---like any research
study---still requires early planning to get the logistics right.¬†

‚Äç

Before you start, you'll need to decide:

-   How long will your study be?
-   Where will it take place?
-   Who should be involved in the study?
-   How will you record your data?
-   Which observational methods will you use?¬†
-   What questions do you hope to answer?

Once you're in the field, you\'ll want this information nailed down to
ensure everything goes smoothly.

‚Äç

For example, some study locations might require planning or permissions
ahead of time. If you're dealing with the public transportation system
of a certain city, you will certainly conduct your research in that
city. But if you want to learn about schools or construction sites, you
need to pick a specific school or construction site. In either case,
preparation also includes forming the professional contacts and
alliances you will need to function in your chosen setting.

‚Äç

Additionally, you may need to involve people other than just the
participants---such as partner organizations, additional researchers,
[**internal
stakeholders**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/internal-stakeholder-interviews),
or parents or teachers in studies involving children. Make sure to loop
these people in as early as possible to avoid any snags after you get
started.¬†

### Methods for ethnographic research

There are multiple research methods that all fall under the category of
field research. These fall into three broad categories---**direct
observation**, **active participation**, and **interviews**---but the
same study may include methods from multiple categories.

‚Äç

#### Direct observation

Direct observation means simply watching somebody (or a group of
somebodies) to see how they behave and why. Ideally, your subject
doesn't care that you're watching and acts exactly as if you were not
there. Under some circumstances, you may be able to hide yourself.¬†

‚Äç

For example, researchers sometimes observe shoppers in malls or gift
shops without anyone knowing they're being watched. However, there are
both ethical and practical limits to incognito observation. In most
cases, you will have to explain your presence to participants and hope
they act naturally.

‚Äç

Data recording may take the form of free-form notes, the use of
structured protocols and data sheets, or audiovisual recording
(supplemented by the researcher\'s notes).

‚Äç

Direct observation can stand on its own, but is also a great way to
gather the information you need to structure later phases of the study.

‚Äç

#### Active participation

Active participation observation means that the researcher joins the
group of people being studied. Data recording is usually by field notes
or diary entries written after the researcher has ceased observations
for the day.¬†

‚Äç

The classic (and largely outdated) example of this method is the
anthropologist who goes to live with a remote population for years on
end. But an equally valid example would be a market researcher who makes
a habit of inviting herself to cook-outs in order to identify design
flaws in popular grill models.¬†

‚Äç

The ethnographic method combines informal [qualitative
interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews)
with direct observation, except that the researcher has given up on
trying to be the proverbial fly on the wall. Instead, the hope is that
the research subjects will act normally because they perceive the
researcher as one of their own.\

### Ethnographic research questions¬†

Ethnography, by nature, can be more open-ended than other types of
research. So you don\'t necessarily need a specific set of research
questions. Rather, ethnographic researchers often begin with defined
topics of study. Field studies exist on a continuum from strictly
observational, where the researcher is as unobtrusive as possible, to
designs involving interviews and product testing. Decide where on that
continuum you need to be to explore your topic properly.

### Recruiting and sampling¬†for ethnographic research

[**Recruiting the right
participants**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/recruiting)
is one of the most important---and challenging---steps for any type of
study, and ethnographic studies are no exception.

‚Äç

Similar to recruiting for other types of qualitative research,
recruitment for ethnographic user research involves:

1.  **Defining your research goals and methodology** (usually covered in
    your [**user research
    plan**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/create-user-research-plan)).¬†
2.  **Determining the best types of participants** to recruit. Consider
    defining your target audience by criteria like psychographics,
    behaviors, demographics, and geographics.¬†
3.  **Determining how many participants you need**. For qualitative
    studies, 5--12 is usually enough to create a valid data set.¬†
4.  **Creating an incentive plan.** Check out our [**Incentive
    Calculator**](https://www.userinterviews.com/lp/ux-research-incentive-calculator)
    for personalized, data-backed recommendations.¬†
5.  **Finding participants.** User Interviews can help! Check out
    [**Recruit**](https://www.userinterviews.com/recruit) to source from
    our 700,000+ pool of participants or [**Research
    Hub**](https://www.userinterviews.com/research-hub) to manage your
    own panel.¬†
6.  **Screening participants.** Head to the [**Screener
    Surveys**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/screener-surveys)
    chapter to learn the what, why, and how of this step.¬†

‚Äç

[**Some
suggest**](https://indeemo.com/blog/remote-ethnographic-user-research)
recruiting in waves to give yourself time to iterate on the data you
collect as the study progresses.¬†

‚Äç

Whatever your approach, collecting informed consent from participants is
essential. [**Here are tools, tips, and templates for collecting
NDAs**](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/ndas-and-informed-consent-for-user-research)
and other informed consent documents from participants.¬†

### In the field

Ethically, participant-researchers must identify themselves as such; the
word for incognito participant observation is \"espionage.\" Whether or
not people who know they are research subjects will ever act entirely
normally is difficult to say, but ideally their behavior is close enough
to normal to yield valid data.

‚Äç

Whenever you finish in the field, pay attention to the process of
leaving. Unless you are simply taking notes on crowd behavior in public,
don\'t just vanish. Let your participants say goodbye to you. As with
introductions, farewells may take five minutes or several weeks,
depending on your situation. Take the relationships you have made during
your research seriously.

### Other considerations in ethnographic research design

As always, be mindful of different types of bias that can seep into your
research:¬†

-   **Observational bias** describes a phenomenon where people behave
    differently when they know they're being studied. It's almost
    impossible to prevent, and a researcher has to know this and account
    for it. The best and really only way to account for this is to
    balance results from other types of research when those being
    studied aren't aware that they're being studied, or when other data
    comes in from more neutral sources.
-   **Observer bias** is the same phenomenon, but from your end---when
    you believe or declare that you've observed something simply because
    you expected it or wanted to observe it. This, too, may be
    impossible to prevent entirely, but an awareness of the situation is
    the first step to curtailing it.

Analyzing ethnographic data¬†
----------------------------

Once you've gathered your observations and anecdotal data, it's time to
organize that data and draw conclusions from it.
[**Analysis**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/research-analysis)
is the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights

‚Äç

Data can be interpreted in any number of ways, so it's up to you to
decide how to analyze it and use it to tell a compelling story about
what your study did (or didn't) achieve. Analysis, done correctly, will
generate the building blocks you'll need to synthesize your results,
create your deliverables, and share your findings with stakeholders.¬†

‚Äç

Because ethnographic data is by nature *qualitative*, there aren't many
hard-and-fast rules for approaching this type of analysis. However, some
[**common qualitative data analysis
methods**](https://www.experiencedynamics.com/blog/2017/06/power-rapid-ethnography)
include:

-   **Affinity diagrams,** which allow you to organize and identify
    meaningful relationships between data points.¬†
-   [**Task
    flows**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/task-analysis)
    that allow you to organize the flow of participant behavior,
    including where they start and what tools and information they need
    to complete the task.¬†
-   [**Journey
    maps**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/customer-journey-maps),
    which are visual representations of the user's experience, including
    all key touch points, pain points, and actions in sequential order.¬†

Whichever method you choose, be sure to revisit the questions you
outlined in your research plan and analyze your data with these in mind.
Other important questions to ask during the analysis might include:

-   Which patterns or themes can you discern in participant behavior?
-   How did participants' behavior change over time?¬†
-   What influenced participants' behavior and decisions?
-   When did participants surprise you?¬†

After analyzing your data, you might find you want to dig deeper. In
that case, you may choose to return to your participants for additional
interviews.\

Sharing ethnographic UX research¬†
---------------------------------

Now that you've discovered meaningful themes and insights from your
data, you need to synthesize and share your findings in a format that
will resonate with stakeholders.¬†

‚Äç

Videos, quotes, voice recordings, stories, and other concrete artifacts
are helpful resources to include in your reports. Stakeholders who
weren't embedded in the field study won't have the same context that you
have, so these types of deliverables will help them get a better sense
of the population and research environment.

### How to write an ethnography¬†

In anthropology or sociology, the findings from ethnographic research
are typically presented as an '**ethnography**'---basically, a paper or
report.¬†

Traditionally, [**an ethnography comprises the following
components**](https://medium.com/media-ethnography/how-to-write-an-ethnography-798e1bd83465):

-   **Thesis:** This section provides a summary of the key takeaways
    from your study. Stakeholders should be able to read this section
    for an 'at-a-glance' understanding of your findings and
    conclusions.¬†
-   **Literature review:** This section analyzes previous research on
    the same topic. By exploring existing research, you gain essential
    background knowledge that illuminates both the importance of your
    own research and places your study within the context of the broader
    research community.¬†
-   **Data collection:** This section explains the type of data you
    collected, your methods for collecting it, and the reasoning behind
    your overall research design.¬†
-   **Data analysis:** This section explains how and why you interpreted
    the data and uses it to support the core messages and conclusions
    you outlined in your thesis.¬†
-   **Reflexivity:** This section discusses your personal investment in
    the study, any limitations you ran into during the research process,
    and any points of potential bias or misinterpretation of the data.¬†

In the context of UX research, your ethnography may not need to follow
exactly the same format. [**Check out this Field Guide
chapter**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/how-to-write-effective-reports-and-presentations)
for more inspiration on writing effective research reports and
deliverables.¬†

Ethnographic user research tools and logistics
----------------------------------------------

### Digital ethnography tools and logistics

The logistics of digital (or 'mobile') ethnography is largely similar to
that of any other kind of remote research method; smartphones,
computers, webcams, and other digital tools will likely come in handy.
However, there are a few [ethnography-specific apps and
tools](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/digital-ethnography-tools-remote-ux-research)
that you should be aware of.

‚Äç

**Data collection tools:**

    ethnography platform that enables remote, non-invasive research of
    human behaviors and user experiences. It allows you to assign,
    capture, and analyze these experiences in the moment, within the
    context of everyday life---without having to go 'in the field' in
    the traditional sense. Because it enables remote ethnography, it's
    particularly effective for studies involving diverse,
    geographically-dispersed populations. Indeemo's dashboard is
    filterable by participants, tasks, keywords, tags, and other
    attributes, so you can quickly and easily review your work so far.¬†

-   [**Contextmapp**](https://www.insightplatforms.com/link/contextmapp/)
    is a mobile research and ethnography solution for customer journey
    mapping, mobile diaries, and co-creation projects. With the ability
    to design studies, invite participants, collect feedback, and
    analyze your data in one platform, it's a great option for managing
    the end-to-end creation of customer journey maps. Its analysis
    dashboard allows you to browse and filter by participant,

**Analysis tools:**

-   [**ATLAS.ti**](https://atlasti.com/) provides intuitive research
    tools for sophisticated data analysis. Supporting a wide variety of
    media types---including textual, graphical, audio, and
    video---ATLAS.ti enables powerful qualitative analysis, insights
    visualization, mind mapping, and more. Because of its flexibility
    and capacity for managing huge amounts of data, it's great for large
    projects and collaborative work.¬†
-   [**QSR NVivo**](https://www.qsrinternational.com/) was designed
    specifically for qualitative and mixed methods data analysis, and
    it's one of the most widely-cited qualitative analysis platforms out
    there. Advanced data management, query, and visualization tools
    allow you to ask complex questions of your data, discover nuanced
    insights, and draw clear, evidence-based conclusions. It also
    provides automated transcription to free your team from menial work,
    as well as collaboration tools to share data and insights across
    teams.¬†
-   If your data is exclusively text-based (written or verbal
    transcriptions),
    [**Tropes**](https://www.semantic-knowledge.com/tropes.htm) is a
    free platform providing high-performance text analysis, qualitative
    analysis, and text mining tools. It enables summarization, semantic
    classification, qualitative analysis, knowledge discovery, and
    more.¬†

### Field studies tools and logistics

The logistical side of field research revolves mostly around travel and
documentation. Consider the following before you go:

-   **Practical matters:** You and your team may need lodging,
    transportation, food, equipment, repairs or replacements, There may
    also be safety considerations, licensing or permissions, and other
    practical matters to take care of before you go.¬†
-   **Equipment:** Technology, chargers, extra batteries, paper and pen,
    NDA/permission agreements, and anything else you need to be
    comfortable in your environment (lunch, water, sunscreen, etc).¬†
-   **Team:** Whether you go alone, with a buddy, or with an entire team
    depends on your research design. ‚ÄçIf you do bring colleagues, it
    might make sense to leave the larger team nearby and switch out
    observers from time to time throughout the study to remain
    unobtrusive and avoid observer bias.
-   **Attire:** Being observed already makes people behave strangely, so
    be culturally sensitive, and dress to belong. Also, check the
    weather and dress accordingly.¬†

As always, an important tool of the trade is always **courtesy** and
**professionalism**. Conducting research on people can be a socially
awkward thing, and you must behave in a respectful and trustworthy
manner at all times or no one will cooperate with you.

‚Äç

Part of respect and trustworthiness is **reciprocity**; don't forget to
bring your incentive for participants. Incentives can range from
monetary rewards and product giveaways to simple 'thank yous' or free
food. Whatever you offer, include it in your budgeting and other
planning.

Ethnography vs. field studies vs. contextual inquiry
----------------------------------------------------

‚Äç**Field studies** are the most well-known type of ethnographic research
method, and the terms are often conflated.¬†

‚Äç

Commonly, user researchers wonder: What's the difference between
[**field studies vs. ethnographic studies vs. contextual
inquiry**](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/field-studies-ethnographic-studies-contextual-inquiry/)?
To put it simply: not much (or at least, it's not a big deal if you use
the terms interchangeably).¬†

‚Äç

The primary distinction between field studies and other types of
research is the location: Field studies are conducted in the
'field'---you go to wherever your participants are---while other types
of studies are not.

‚Äç

True ethnographic research would take place over the course of days,
weeks or months while living in participants' natural environment, while
contextual inquiry involves asking questions within this context (as
opposed to pure, removed observation). But for the purposes of UX
research, these differences are subtle and largely unimportant.¬†

‚Äç

### ‚ÄçWhat are ethnographic field studies?

[As defined by NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/field-studies/),
**field studies** are qualitative research activities that take place in
the user's context rather than in your office or lab.¬†

‚Äç

Some of the questions field studies can address include:

-   **How do your potential users talk about a given issue?** When your
    users belong to a culture or subculture different from yours, they
    likely use jargon and terminology that differs from yours as well.
    Listening in the field is a great way to learn their language.
-   **What is the cultural context of the need you want to address?**
    Products are designed to solve problems---but if your target users
    have a life context very different from yours, you are likely to
    misunderstand (and be unable to solve) their problems. Field studies
    are an excellent way to better understand your customers' problems,
    so you can offer them meaningful solutions.¬†
-   **How do the circumstances your users face vary?** By visiting
    multiple study sites, or one study site multiple times, you can gain
    insight into what commonalities your potential users have, how they
    differ from each other, and how adaptable your product (and your
    marketing) will have to be to support these differences.¬†
-   **What variables are relevant to your research?** If you don\'t ask
    the right questions, you won\'t get the right answer. For example,
    if men and women use your product differently, then you\'ll have
    to[control for gender in your study
    designs](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/find-good-research-participants).
    If the ambient air temperature changes what users need from your
    product, then you\'ll have to test it at multiple temperatures. If
    the age or educational status of your users matters, then you\'d
    better not recruit all of your study participants from an
    anthropology professor\'s classroom.

### When to choose field studies for UX research

Field studies provide the most complete, unbiased picture of what
potential users actually do. Unfortunately, field studies are expensive
and can be time-consuming, due to the need for travel and the greater
number of hours required by researchers. For these reasons, most
research teams use them only when no other method will do.

‚Äç

Choosing a field study for UX research might be a good idea when:

-   **You need to understand the big picture.** If your product is
    designed to function in a particular context, testing in a lab might
    not give you accurate results. You can also use field studies to
    explore a need that you hope your as-yet-uncreated product will
    fill.¬†
-   **You're starting from the beginning.** What do you do when you
    don\'t know enough about your potential customers to ask good
    questions about them? A study that asks inapplicable questions is
    worse than useless, being not only uninformative but also
    misleading. In this case, a field study is a good way to get the
    information you need to begin more focused research.
-   **Your research can't fit in the lab.** Even if you can lab-test
    your product, doing so might not be practical. For example, if your
    device is designed to function as a component of the navigational
    system of an oil tanker, going to an oil tanker for final testing
    makes sense. You probably have an R&D budget for field studies if
    you\'re in the oil tanker business, too.

### How to conduct ethnographic field studies

Field studies come with a much higher level of unpredictability and less
control than studies conducted in a lab or a controlled environment.
[According to Singleton and Straits
(2005)](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&context=tqr),
the process for conducting a field study is as follows:

1.  **Define the focus of the study**, including any problems you're
    hoping to solve and questions you'd like to answer.¬†
2.  **Choose your location.** You'll want to find a place where your
    target audience is likely to be found, but are also easily
    observed.¬†
3.  **Gain access.** Depending on the location you choose, you may need
    to gain special permissions or an onsite representative to accompany
    you.¬†
4.  **Present yourself appropriately.** Whether you're doing covert
    research or presenting yourself as a researcher, you need to choose
    the right attire, role, and space to fit into the setting without
    disrupting participants' natural behavior.¬†
5.  **Record data.** Recording your observations in the field can be
    complicated, so you need to choose the right format: video,
    hand-written notes, audio recordings, etc.¬†

Other ethnographic methods
--------------------------

### Contextual inquiry (ethnographic interviews)

**Contextual inquiry**, also known as '**observation**' or
'**ethnographic interviews**', involves watching and listening to users
in their natural environment. Often, what participants say they do and
what they actually do is different, so observing them will give you a
better understanding of their daily activities.¬†

‚Äç

#### How to conduct a contextual inquiry

[**According to
NN/g**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/contextual-inquiry/), the
process for conducting contextual inquiry interviews involves four
parts:

1.  **The primer:** Building rapport, managing expectations, discussing
    consent and confidentiality, and easing into the conversation with
    your participant.¬†
2.  **The transition:** Explaining to the participant how the rest of
    the interview will work, what they can expect, and how they can
    expect to interact with you moving forward.¬†
3.  **The contextual interview:** Observing the participant as they
    perform the task, stopping to ask questions or gain clarification as
    needed.¬†
4.  **The wrapup:** Asking any final questions, summarizing your
    takeaways, and giving the participant one last chance to provide
    clarification or feedback.¬†

#### Types of ethnographic interviews

Below is a guide that may serve as a useful template for choosing your
approach to ethnographic interviews:¬†

-   **Informal interviews** are simply conversations, though the
    researcher may have certain areas of inquiry in mind.
-   **A semi-structured interview is formal**, and has a designated area
    of focus. The researcher seeds the discussion with the same series
    of questions or prompts for every interviewee.
-   **Structured, open-ended interviews** allow the researcher to follow
    a set script, and the questions are carefully planned so as to not
    suggest answers. For example: "You want electronics that are easy to
    use, right?\" Leading questions are avoided, as always in good
    qualitative research.

### Digital ethnography

**Digital ethnography**, also called '**mobile ethnography**' or
'**virtual ethnography**,' is a form of ethnographic research that
occurs, well, digitally. Rather than traveling to join your participants
in their environments, you design tasks for them to record in their
natural environments using videos, pictures, audio, or other digital
artifacts.¬†

\

#### Methods for digital ethnography

You can practice digital ethnography in a variety of ways, including:

-   **Netnographic methods**, which involve collecting data from free,
    previously-existing content. This includes joining Reddit groups,
    reading reviews on competitors' websites, monitoring conversations
    on social media, and watching relevant YouTube videos. Because this
    content is posted organically, you can immerse yourself in your
    target audience's community to learn more about their thoughts and
    experiences.¬†
-   **Asynchronous interviews.** One-to-one interviews aren't always
    possible---if, for example, you and your participants live in
    different time zones. Asynchronous interviews allow both you and
    your participants the flexibility to interact at the times that work
    best for each of you. They can be conducted using text-based
    technology like email or video technology like Zoom.¬†
-   **Watching videos or screen-share recordings.** Videos are a great
    way to observe users' behavior in context without invading their
    space. You might choose to design tasks for participants to perform
    on camera, or ask them to go about a particular activity as they
    normally would. In the context of app and product design,
    screen-share recordings allow you to observe users' interactions
    with the product without having to stand over their shoulders.
-   **Digital diaries** are conducted similarly to a typical diary study
    via apps, smartphones, or other digital technology. They enable
    researchers to monitor diary entries in real-time and adjust or ask
    additional questions as needed, while providing participants with a
    more convenient way to submit their responses.¬†

Any of the digital ethnography tools listed above are great options for
conducting your research.¬†

‚Äç

#### Examples of digital ethnography

-   [**What Motivates Consumers to Participate in
    Boycotts**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223316121_What_Motivates_Consumers_to_Participate_in_Boycotts_Lessons_from_the_Ongoing_Canadian_Seafood_Boycott):
    This study, published in the Journal of Business Research, used
    netnographic methods---looking at comments left on an online
    petition---to analyze the motivations behind consumers' decisions to
    boycott seafood.¬†
-   [**Developing Successful New Banking
    Products**](https://www.cmnty.com/blog/atb-financial-money-secure-customer-insights/):
    This study, conducted by the banking app Brightside, involved
    creating a digital research community where consumers could talk
    about their banking habits. Brightside used the insights gleaned
    from this ethnographic study to develop new solutions.¬†
-   [**Using Eye Tracking to Optimize Product
    Packaging**](https://www.tobiipro.com/applications/marketing-user-research/shopper-research/):
    In this study, Unilever used eye tracking technology to follow
    shoppers through their shopping journeys and understand how they
    interacted with packaging in-store. By literally looking through
    their shoppers' eyes, they were able to better understand what
    captures their attention to improve packaging design.¬†

### Rapid ethnography¬†

**Rapid ethnography**, also known as '**mini ethnography**' or
'**focused ethnography**,' is essentially ethnography on fast-forward.
Researchers use typical ethnographic methods, but in a much shorter
timeframe with more focused inquiry---and because of the fast-paced
nature of the UX field, this is pretty much always going to be the case
in ethnographic UX research.¬†

‚Äç

#### Methods for rapid ethnography

Rapid ethnography doesn't differ too much from traditional ethnography,
using methods like:

-   Field notes
-   Direct observation
-   Focus groups
-   Diary studies
-   Informal interviews

##### **UXR¬†Case Study: Ethnographic Thinking to Understand Unknowns** 

###### Thinking like an ethnographer means having users act out and paint for you the contexts in which they experience the world.  When designing a new health insurance service for farm employers, we used ethnographic thinking to study employers' pain points and priorities in managing their employees' health. We observed how farm employers explored healthcare, their spending habits, and the role of health insurance in their lives and those of their employees.  Although farm employers didn\'t explicitly discuss or describe scenarios of race, apartheid, or land rights during their interviews, it was the big elephant in the room that shaped how we came to interpret their transcripts and, ultimately, the recommendations that we delivered to the client. In this context, the users---the farm employers---were predominantly white males presiding over black farm employees in South Africa, just 25 years after apartheid.  Ethnographic thinking helped us capture the racial, historical, and socioeconomic divisions underlying the healthcare market we were seeking to serve. From these contexts we designed a list of employee health insurance benefits that would position the client to act as a champion in reducing health inequalities and impacting social change.  Rachel Ceasar, PhD Global Health Tech Researcher[** Culture of Health+Tech Consulting**](https://www.cultureofhealthtech.com/)

Hybrid research: Combining ethnography with other methods
---------------------------------------------------------

Ethnography often pairs well with [**diary
studies**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/diary-studies).
In a diary study, users record their own entries in a log or diary over
a determined period of time. Ethnography can be quite labor-intensive,
and traditional ethnographic note taking might not be possible, or might
tax resources and budgets. Employing a diary study is a great
alternative to enable deeper, longer-lasting research or to continue
when researchers can't be there to observe.

In general, field studies are only the initial stage of a larger
research effort. The fieldwork explores the context and helps set the
research parameters for the rest of the project. Some aspects of a field
study can grade into laboratory-type research as you are essentially
creating a temporary lab on site. Explore these[**discovery research
methods**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/discovery-methods)
to continue your research design.¬†

A final note
------------

‚ÄçRemember that ethnographic research doesn't need to be complicated,
doesn't have to take an excessive amount of time, and doesn't have to
involve specialist researchers.¬†

‚Äç

In fact, while a good field study should always yield a report that can
be read and understood by people uninvolved in the study, part of the
point of field research is to get out there and talk with the people who
will use your product. Get to know and understand them. If you can
develop an intuitive (and accurate!) feel for your customers, you will
be much better at creating and selling products that feel intuitive to
them.\

*Today I learned that diary studies are a relatively hands-off and
economical way to gather loads of useful longitudinal qualitative data
(and sometimes quantitative data, too).¬†¬†Sounds neat, huh?¬†*

‚Äç

In this chapter, we'll dig into diary-based studies and how this method
can be used to uncover insights over a period of time.

### In this chapter:

-   What is a diary study?
-   When to choose this method
-   How to conduct a diary study
-   Tools and software
-   Hybrid research: Combining methods
-   The pros and cons of diary studies

What is a diary study?
----------------------

A **diary study** (sometimes called a camera study) is a UX research
method in which participants keep a log of their thoughts, experiences,
and activities over a defined period of time, usually a few days to
several weeks.

‚Äç

Diary studies provide a self-reported and *longitudinal* record of
users' behaviors and attitudes that researchers later parse and analyze
to better understand habits and patterns.¬†

‚Äç

Study participants may be asked to log data as events occur or might be
prompted at predefined intervals (for example, via an email or text
message at a particular time of day).

‚Äç

This method is a relatively hands-off and cost-effective way to learn
about the how and why of the user experience in context. Because of
this, [diary studies have been
called](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies/) "the poor man's
field study," but we think that characterization sells the method a bit
short.¬†

‚Äç\

Diary studies are an economical compromise between a highly structured
lab-based study and an open-ended observational field-based ethnographic
study---and for UX researchers working on digital products, a diary
study is often a perfectly good alternative to on-site field studies.

When to choose diary studies
----------------------------

Diary studies can help you learn more about how users act in real-world
situations.

‚Äç

This method has a place in many different types of research, but is
especially useful in UX research because of the fine-grained, contextual
information diary studies can offer product and design teams. It's one
of the few ways to really get a peek into how users interact with your
product in a real-world setting over a period of days or weeks.

‚Äç

Diary studies are useful for understanding long-term behaviors or
processes like:

-   **User habits.** What does a typical work day look like for your
    users? Where and when in a user's day do they reach for your
    product? What behaviors are spontaneous vs. planned?
-   **Attitudes and feelings.** How do users feel as they complete a
    task or use your product? Why do they make certain decisions?¬†¬†¬†
-   **User journeys.** How do users' feelings and perceptions about your
    brand change over time? What unexpected points of friction or
    delight do users experience?¬†
-   **Context of use.** When, why, and how does life interrupt use of
    your product? What do users do immediately before or after using
    your product?\

### When in the product development cycle to use diary studies

This method is especially useful when you're in the early discovery
phases of your product or project. You can use diary studies to learn
more about the process users currently use to solve a problem, look at
products you want to create or replace, or better understand the precise
layers of the pain points you seek to solve.

‚Äç

Diary studies are also useful for testing early-stage products or
prototypes in order to identify any necessary changes, before altering
the course of a build becomes too onerous.

‚Äç

And they can also be useful at the very end of the development cycle. At
these later stages, you can dig into the user experience to see if your
products are being handled in the anticipated ways in order to fine-tune
details.

##### Intuit + diary studies 

###### Since the company's founding days, Intuit has stressed the importance of studying customers in their everyday environments. Intuit oversees a line of business and consumer-oriented financial tools that more than 37 million customers use each year to track expenses, manage payroll, and pay taxes.  Diary studies keep the company close to customer behavior. Teams that participate in these studies are cross-functional, consisting of research, engineering, product, and design leaders. These observational research studies uncover points of feedback that may otherwise remain undetected, and findings are shared throughout the company.*  \"By observing someone in their natural habitat we can determine how often they get interrupted when they are trying to do taxes, payroll, or perform some other task. Many people are probably not even mindful of how many interruptions they get or how many things distract them as they work on finances.\"  ‚Äç*-Intuit CFO, Neil Williams, via [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/intuits-cfo-wants-to-follow-you-home-and-watch-you-work-2015-12)

How to conduct a diary study
----------------------------

Actually conducting a diary study has five main phases: planning,
recruiting and onboarding, monitoring, debriefing, and analysis. It's
important to put roughly equal energy and effort into all five phases to
get useful and usable results.\

----------------------

If you're reading this Field Guide in order, you're probably sick of
hearing it, but here we go:

‚Äç

Step one of any user research study is identifying your goals and
defining a specific, actionable, and practical research question.¬† Step
two is figuring out [which
method](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-types)
is the right one for your goals.

‚Äç

We assume that if you've read this far, you're probably pretty confident
that a diary study is the right method for your current research goals.
So we won't belabor the point, but just in case...

‚Äç

If you don't already have clear goals and an effective research question
in hand, circle back to the chapter on [How to Create a User Research
Plan](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/create-user-research-plan)
to hammer those out. Then, be sure to revisit the chapter on [choosing a
user research
method](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/how-to-choose-a-research-method)
to confirm that a diary study is really the most appropriate method for
your goals.

‚Äç

Once you've done *that*, you can start planning your diary study in
earnest. This is the fun-challenging part!

‚Äç

There are many different ways to conduct a diary study---which one you
choose depends on who your participants are, the kind of information
you're hoping to learn, and the resources at your disposal. Here are
some of the choices you'll need to consider along the way.

### Study topic scope

The focus on your study will be determined by your goals, and may be
broad ("what does a typical day for third-grade teachers involve?") or
narrow ("how do third-grade teachers use this specific math workbook?").

‚Äç\

[Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies)
breaks diary topic scopes into 4 categories:

\

-   Product or website (e.g. understand *all* the interactions with an
    app)
-   Behavior (e.g. general information about smartphone usage)
-   General activity (e.g. how people shop for groceries)
-   A specific activity (e.g. how people use a particular app to buy
    groceries)¬†¬†

### Study format: online vs offline

The most basic diary format is a **notebook and a pen or pencil**, a
low-cost and straight-forward option. Unfortunately, not all
participants have legible handwriting, and handwritten diaries must
later be digitized, adding another step to the processes of analysis and
archiving. If you want participants to include images with their diary,
consider including a **disposable camera** as part of their kit, or
(more likely in 2022), instruction for uploading digital photos.

‚Äç

Smartphones are now so ubiquitous that using **an app** for the diary
may be more comfortable for many users, though typing a lot of text into
a phone might be uncomfortable for some. Electronic diaries can also
take on other forms beyond the written word: entries can be logged by
voice, video, or photos.¬†

‚Äç

There are several well-rated diary apps already available in app stores
(we cover a handful below in the tools and logistics section), or you
can create your own. Bear in mind that using an app means you will have
to train participants how to use it.¬†

‚Äç

**Laptops or desktop computers** tend to be less ideal, since they are
not as portable, convenient, or discreet. But if the scope of your diary
study is narrowly focused on, say, a participant's interaction with B2B
software as part of their work day, you might also give them the option
to log their entries that way.

‚Äç

You can also combine methods like creating a daily or regular-use
questionnaire via mobile that can be paired with typed or handwritten
notes. Just be sure not to over complicate things, either for yourself
or your participants.

### Diary structure¬†

Another consideration is whether you want your participants' diaries to
be free-form or structured?

‚Äç

A **free-form or open diary** is similar to the personal diaries or
journals some people already keep. You'll still want to give your
subjects some initial guidance, by and large a free-form diary is quite
loose, and the subjects determine how and when to record feedback (when
they're already using a product) or to record their experience as they
accomplish certain tasks or go about their day.

‚Äç

Free-form diaries require less training and encourage the user to
speculate and to offer information you didn't ask for and might not
think to ask for. The risk is that the participant might not include the
information you need---or might include way *too* much information.¬†

‚Äç

A **structured or closed diary**, meanwhile, is more like a survey, with
closed-ended questions on pre-set forms. Because their format is
consistent across participants, structured diaries are much more
straightforward to analyze.

‚Äç

Mixed approaches of various kinds are also an option. How much structure
you use depends on where your study falls on a continuum between the
need for open-ended communication on the one hand, and precise answers
to specific questions on the other.

‚Äç

A structured diary might include:

-   An introduction page with **clear instructions** about how and how
    often participants should log their data. If you're asking
    participants to include photos or videos, be sure to provide clear
    instructions on how to do so.
-   **One page for every day of the study** (or every day participants
    are expected to fill in the diary, if not daily) with
    questions/prompts and space to answer
-   A final page with a list of **concluding questions** that
    participants will fill out at the very end of a study.¬†

##### Sample diary study questions

For a structured or hybrid diary study, you might ask questions like:

-   Describe your morning.¬†
-   What is the most important thing you have to do today?
-   What were you doing immediately before \[task\]?
-   What was the hardest part about doing \[task\]?
-   Which parts of \[task\] were you unsure about/lacked confidence in?
-   How did you feel while doing \[task\]?
-   Why did you feel that way?
-   How could that experience have been better?\

### Logging techniques

The next thing to think about is the logging protocol. Whether you're
asking participants to complete a free-form or structured diary, you'll
want to provide them guidance around when to fill out their diary. There
are three categories of diary protocols:

-   **Interval-contingent protocol** in which diaries have to be filled
    out at regular, predetermined intervals (e.g. every 6 hours, once
    per day, one entry per week, etc). To avoid missing data,
    participants may need occasional reminders to maintain a consistent
    logging habit.
-   **Signal-contingent** **protocol**, in which you prompt the
    participant to make an entry with a notification alert, call, text
    message, or other signal. This method is effective, but intrusive.¬†
-   **Event-contingent** **protocol**, which requires the participant to
    fill in their diary whenever a specific something happens---after
    using your product, after making an online purchase, when it begins
    to rain, when their baby needs their diaper changed, etc.¬†

Event-contingent protocol is also known as **in-situ logging**, and is a
straightforward method for collecting data, but does require
participants to fill in their diary immediately after (or even during) a
relevant activity, which can end up being disruptive.¬†

‚Äç

A modified version of this method is called the **snippet technique**,
in which participants record brief notes at the time of the event so as
not to forget key points, and then follow up and expand on their
snippets with more information at the end of the day.

‚Äç

Whatever logging method you choose will depend almost entirely on your
research questions.

### Study duration

Diary studies can take place over a few days, or they can go on for
months. The optimal length depends wholly on the nature of your study.
But do keep in mind¬† that the longer your diary study is, the more
likely it is that participants will drop out or become unresponsive
later in the study. Make your study as short as possible while still
being long enough to answer your research question fully. If you don't
really need that extra week of entries, cut it!

\

Regardless of study length, be sure to check in on participants
regularly to keep them engaged and answer any questions that might crop
up.

\

### Additional considerations

Your diary study may involve collecting **sensitive or personal
information** about your participant and you will have to take steps to
either safeguard or destroy all such information. Your recruitment and
onboarding processes should include obtaining **informed consent**. That
means getting express permission from participants after¬† advising them
that you're collecting information, why collecting this information is
important, how you plan to use¬† and store the data they share, and what
you're doing to minimize risk.¬†

‚Äç

It's also a good idea to conduct a **pilot study** to make sure your
diary study design is sound. Recruit a couple teammates to help you
practice onboarding and debriefing participants, test drive your¬†
materials to make sure the logging instructions are clear, and
troubleshoot any tools or processes that participants will be expected
to use.¬†

Recruiting and onboarding diary study participants¬†
---------------------------------------------------

There are two parts to diary study recruitment. The first---finding and
screening participants ---is similar to recruiting for other qualitative
research methods.

\

The second---briefing and onboarding participants---is a more involved
process than you may be used to if you typically stick to, say, user
interviews.

### Finding and screening participants

For starters, you'll need to have a good idea about who, exactly, can
help you answer your research question. If you haven't already, we
highly (highly!) recommend reading the chapter [How to Recruit
Participants for User Research
Studies](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/find-good-research-participants)
to learn more about defining your participant profile and screening
criteria.

\

We also encourage you to read the chapter on [screener
surveys](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/screener-surveys)
carefully---you'll need a good screener to find participants who are not
only qualified to answer your questions, but who are willing and
communicative enough to stick with the demands of a long-term research
study.

\

[Tony
Turner](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-magic-of-diary-studies-with-tony-turner-of-progressive),
UX Researcher at Meta, emphasizes the importance of screening for
articulation in diary study recruitment:

‚Äç

> "The key thing is to \[have\] screeners that get at how interactive
> the participant is in terms of answering questions and things like
> that. So having questions in the screener that give them an
> opportunity to be verbose (or not) and learning about them that way."

\

Your study might call for as few as 3 or as many as 30
participants---the number will, naturally, depend on the scope and
budget of your project.¬†

\

For a typical diary study, aim to recruit **10 to 15 participants**.
It's also not a bad idea to recruit a couple more folks as a buffer
against potential dropouts.

### Incentivizing participants

It's always important to compensate your study participants fairly. How
and how much you offer should be informed by the participant's level of
expertise, the amount of time and effort required, and (of course) your
own budget.

\

We wrote [a whole chapter on UX research
incentives](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ux-research-incentives)---including
the different formats these can take---and even made a handy [User
Research Incentive
Calculator](https://www.userinterviews.com/lp/ux-research-incentive-calculator)
to help you figure out the right amount for your study.

\

#### Special considerations for diary study incentives

-   Remember that you're asking a lot of participants. Although the
    logging itself may be simple, keeping a diary requires dedication
    and time. This should be reflected in a **higher incentive rate**.
-   As part of your periodic check-ins, **remind participants** about
    what they stand to receive for completing the study.¬†
-   If you're offering cash or gift card incentives, you might want to
    consider distributing your incentives **in installments** to keep
    participants motivated throughout the study.¬†
-   If the study involves testing a device or software, you could also
    offer participants the possibility to **keep the product** as a
    final reward for completing the study.¬†\

### Onboarding participants

After recruiting participants, you'll need to train them. Diary studies
require a lot of (unmoderated) effort from participants, and your
onboarding process should include a pre-study brief with thorough
instructions about what, exactly, you want them to do.

‚Äç

Schedule a face-to-face meeting with each participant (this can be
in-person or virtual) to discuss the details of the study. Make sure
they're clear on the timeline, logging schedule, and expectations around
entry content and quality. Give them a walkthrough of the tools and
technology they will be using, and leave plenty of time for questions.

‚Äç

But don't rely on their memory alone---include clear written
instructions and a reminder about expectations in the diary itself, so
participants always have the most important information on hand.

‚Äç

[Nielsen Norman Group
recommends](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies/) providing
participants with a simple framework:

Be as specific as possible about what information you need participants
to log, without stifling natural variability and differences that you
cannot plan for. (Discovering the unexpected is after all one of the
primary reasons to do user research.) Create clear and detailed
instructions for logging. Give users example log entries to help them
understand the level of detail you need from them. (But make sure you
don't bias participants toward those types of entries that you happened
to provide as examples.)

During the logging period¬†¬†
---------------------------

Once the study begins, you may need to remind them to make their diary
entries, and they might have questions for you about the process. Plan
to check in on your participants regularly to support consistent logging
and to address issues as they come up.

‚Äç

Exactly how closely you monitor participants throughout the study
depends on your study design and perhaps also on the needs of individual
participants. The longer a study is the harder it will be for
participants to stick with it. (A few weeks is a good maximum length for
most diary studies for this reason.)

‚Äç

During your check ins, be sure to recognize the efforts of participants
that are engaged and creating quality entries per your instructions (a
friendly "keep up the good work" goes a long way). For participants who
are less engaged or seem to be struggling, take time to answer their
questions and offer encouragement.

\

Debriefing participants with post-study interviews
--------------------------------------------------

After you collect all the completed diaries, you should plan to meet
with each participant to discuss their diary entries in detail.

‚Äç

To prepare for your debrief, review each participant\'s diary
entries---you might also want to begin the analysis process ahead of
time by tagging and coding the data. Then, conduct one-on-one followup
interviews with each participant. Ask them to expand on their entries or
clarify where needed, and incorporate the information into your study
results for analysis in the next step.

‚Äç

The post-study interview is also a chance to personally thank each
person for their efforts and gather feedback about the participant
experience.¬†

\

Analyzing and sharing diary study data
--------------------------------------

Analysis transforms your raw data (the diaries, debriefing interview
transcripts, and whatever other information you have gathered) into
insights you can use.¬†

If diaries were hand-written or voice-recorded, step one of analysis
will be transcribing the diaries into a format that can be analyzed
using spreadsheets or specialized software.¬†

‚Äç

Next, you will want to revisit your research questions. Diary studies
create a lot (*a lot*) of qualitative data and it's easy to get lost
among all the interesting nuggets of information you're likely to
encounter as you dig in. Be clear about your research questions and the
goals of your study, and focus your initial analysis on answering those
first.¬†

‚Äç

Questions to ask during diary study analysis include:

-   How do target behaviors evolve and change over time?
-   What influences certain behaviors or decisions?
-   What similarities and differences do you observe between
    participants' processes?

The feedback you get from diary studies can be difficult to organize.
Our [Diary Study Launch
Kit](https://www.userinterviews.com/launch-kit/diary-study) includes an
analysis spreadsheet template that automatically organizes diary entries
so you can spend more time on analyzing and synthesizing the data and
less time sifting through it.¬†¬†

\

In general, we find Google Sheets to be a pretty good way to organize
research feedback. It's a free, widely accessible tool that your whole
team can use, even remotely. And while it doesn't have all the power of
a dedicated research repository or diary study tool, it's a good way for
getting started.

‚Äç

If you used a highly structured diary format, you may also have
quantitative data to analyze with statistical analysis software or some
deft spreadsheet formulas, which can then be layered in with qualitative
insights.

###### üí° **Pro tip:** As a rule, it's a good idea to figure out what type of analysis will best serve a study *before* you begin, since analysis methods must be matched to both your research questions and your study design. Knowing how you plan to analyze incoming data also makes it possible to tag data as it rolls in, saving your team time at the end of a study.

### How to share diary study results

After analyzing the data, you can construct a [**customer journey
map**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/customer-journey-maps)
that shows the user experience, pain points, and opportunities plotted
over time. You can read more about how to create a customer journey map
in this Field Guide chapter. We also put together a (giant) [list of
journey map templates and
examples](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/best-customer-journey-map-templates-examples)
for you to borrow from.

‚Äç

Include your journey map in your [final research
report](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/research-deliverables-reporting)---this
can be a written report, slide deck, and/or a live presentation.
Consider including quotes from the diaries or post-study interviews in
your report, along with any images, videos, or voice recordings you may
have collected.¬†

‚Äç

research report templates and
examples](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/ux-research-presentations-reports-templates-examples).
You can also borrow and adapt our own simple [UX research
summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1ASvX6nPMX8au8iQxACRo3T6JGGjv12k1FvZtORhos/edit)

templates---the same ones used by the User Interviews team.\

###### üí° **Pro tip:** You don't have to wait until you have a polished customer journey map or final report to share diary study results with stakeholders. If you're using a structured format and reviewing diary entries as you go, you might consider analyzing and synthesizing the data at set intervals.¬†

###### For example, if your diary study is focused on the user experience of a fitness app, you might share early insights about participants' progress or commitment levels at the 3-day, 1-week, and 2-week marks.

Diary study tools and software
------------------------------

There are a number of off-the-shelf diary study tools out there,
although these aren't always practical for small teams, or for teams
just getting started with diary studies.¬†

If you're assembling your own toolkit, you'll need to provide each
participant with the following:

-   **Diaries** (either digital or physical)
-   **The product** to be tested (if applicable)¬†
-   **A place to upload** images, videos, or voice recordings (if
    applicable)\*

\*This could be Google Drive, Dropbox, or simply an email address or
phone number for texting media.

You will also need solutions for:

-   [Recruiting, screening, and communicating with
    participants](https://www.userinterviews.com/)(hey, that's us!)
-   Meeting with participants---[a video conferencing tool like
    Zoom](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/zoom-user-interviews-integration-making-your-workflow-way-easier)
    or a researcher-specific solution like
    [Lookback](https://www.lookback.com/)
-   [Transcribing](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/user-research-recordings-analysis)
    handwritten entries and audio/video recordings
-   Organizing and analyzing data---feel free to adapt [our analysis
    spreadsheet](https://www.userinterviews.com/launch-kit/diary-study),
    or see below for more robust options
-   Storing and sharing data and insights post-analysis

If you are collecting and retaining sensitive personal information (such
as where participants go during the day, how they use social media, or
any medical or banking information) you will also need some way to keep
that information secure until it is no longer needed and can be
destroyed.

Hybrid research: Combining diary studies with other methods¬†
------------------------------------------------------------

Diary studies can be combined with other methods in order to expand the
reach of the study while keeping costs manageable. As we've discussed,
diary studies are a means of observing natural use of a product. So, it
can be handy to combine diary studies with some more quantitative
methods that might fill in and support this same discovery stage of
research.

\

**Surveys** are commonly paired with diary studies. For example, you may
use a widely-distributed survey to collect the information you'll use to
develop the diary study. (Example: A survey might tell you how many
times a day people drop their phones on the floor, and in a diary study,
you get to learn more about the circumstances under which they drop
their phones.)

\

Or, you could use the results of a diary study to develop further
research questions that you then explore in a survey. (Example: A diary
study might show that people are super diligent about flossing their
teeth in the few weeks after a cleaning, and less so over time. You
could follow this up with a survey to ask what might motivate them to
continue flossing consistently.)

\

Other complementary methods include:

-   [**Interviews**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews)---a
    brief diary study can be used to prompt self-reflection ahead of
    in-depth interviews.
-   [**User
    analytics**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-analytics)---in
    addition to self-reported behaviors, you might also track in-product
    behaviors using analytics tools
-   [**Focus
    groups**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/focus-groups)---after
    one-on-one debrief interviews, you might find it valuable to gather
    study participants for a one-time focus group discussion after to
    see if any additional insights emerge¬†
-   **Co-design**---diary study participants may good candidates for a
    participatory design study, since they will have been thinking about
    a product or process extensively and are likely to have developed
    some opinions about the optimal solution

The pros and cons of diary studies
----------------------------------

There are many avenues researchers can take to gather contextual
understandings about users in their natural habitats, but none are
without their drawbacks. Some solutions are more costly than others
(extended[**field
studies**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-academy-lesson/field-studies),
for example), others can be somewhat unnatural (asking users to repeat
real-life behaviors in a lab environment), and others may be unreliable
(retroactively trying to understand context through a survey.)

‚Äç

Every UX research method has its challenges, but the good news is: the
challenges you might encounter with diary studies are manageable.¬†

‚Äç

#### Potential diary study pitfalls and how to mitigate them

**Keeping a diary is a lot of work**.¬†

-   **Problem:** Some participants might lose steam or forget---not
    everyone who agrees to begin the study will record diary entries
    correctly and diligently, and some will drop out before the end.
-   **Solution:** Consistent communication and incremental rewards. You
    may wish to set up alerts, or reach out to participants directly to
    be sure they're still engaged and committed. For longer studies,
    consider distributing incentives periodically to keep motivation
    high.

**Data can be challenging to analyze.**¬†

-   **Problem:** The process of[**analyzing qualitative
    data**](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/how-to-analyze-qualitative-data-with-the-design-gym)
    is a whole different ball game from analyzing quantitative data:
    qualitative data is just more cumbersome, and is more challenging to
    automate. Diary studies can be even more challenging than other
    types of qualitative data because you'll be dealing with the
    meanderings of people's minds.
-   **Solution**: If possible, use a digital diary format. This at least
    reduces the need for transcription, which will save time later. It
    can also enable you to create sortable fields (like time of day of
    each log) and automate tagging. Making diaries digital will allow
    you to search keywords and more easily identify trends when it comes
    time for analysis.

**Self-reported data may not be totally accurate.**¬†

-   **Problem**: Human beings are unreliable narrators---we all have
    blind spots, biases, and are generally bad at predicting our own
    future behaviors. Even the most diligent, upstanding participant is
    likely to miss or misrepresent details, recall information partially
    or inaccurately, and inject their own unconscious biases into their
    observations.
-   **Solution**: Keep diary study tasks and prompts focused on past or
    current behaviors---don't ask participants to hypothesize about
    their future selves. You can also use your screening process and
    onboarding meetings to get to know your participants and identify
    biases they may bring to the study. This knowledge may help you
    interpret or report on diary study data more accurately. And of
    course, diary studies are just one piece of the puzzle---supplement
    the data you gather through this method with moderated studies,
    product analytics, and/or a high volume of quantitative data for a
    more complete understanding of the user experience.

#### The advantages of diary studies

No research method is perfect, and as we've just shared, diary studies
do come with drawbacks (although the more serious pitfalls are easily
avoided).

\

If you've considered your options and have decided a diary study is the
best way to answer your research question---we say, go for it! The pros
far outweigh the cons with this method.

\

Among other things, diary studies:

-   **Capture** **temporal dynamics.** Many common research methods fall
    short when it comes to capturing how time influences the user
    experience. One of the most compelling reasons to conduct diary
    studies is that they allow researchers to efficiently collect
    longitudinal qualitative data from multiple participants
    simultaneously---*without* intensive field study or moderation.
-   **Reflect real-world environments and natural context of use.**
    Diary studies help researchers understand how a product is used and
    experienced in the real world. Like observational methods such as
    field studies, diary studies can help reveal external
    factors---distractions, social situations, technical limitations,
    etc---that may influence real-world usage.
-   **Give participants time to think deeply about their experience.**
    Diary studies allow participants to take the time they need to put
    their thoughts and feelings into words, and to express themselves in
    a variety of formats. This in-depth introspection and creative
    feedback can be a fantastic complement to other methods like [first
    click
    testing](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/first-click-testing)
    that capture initial responses or reflexive decision making.¬†¬†\

What's more, as [Kelly
Moran](https://uxdesign.cc/diary-studies-cd65a61a4f89), Staff UX
Researcher at Google, observes:

> "‚Äã‚ÄãThese studies often surface topics that a team has not thought to
> pursue in other, more tightly controlled research because the team
> does not know it exists as a phenomenon. This can include topics and
> phenomena that participants have not brought up in interviews because
> they simply did not come to mind in that interview moment.

\

One final benefit to diary studies is the ability they give your team to
"get smart" about the population before going out to the field when used
as a first step in a multi-phase discovery project. The team can head
out already knowing about specific instances they can probe into in more
depth. A positive byproduct of getting to know the respondents before we
meet for face-to-face observation is the breaking down of some initial
barriers. Arriving with a foundation of rapport already laid down means
we can get right into meaningful observation shortly after arrival."

‚ÄçA final word
-------------

Diary studies are just one piece of the user research puzzle---it would
be unwise to make sweeping design decisions based *only* on diary study
data. But the same can be said for literally any other UX research
method.

\

If you're looking for an economical way to collect in-depth, contextual,
longitudinal data that captures the voice of the user, there's no better
tool to have in your belt.\

A focus group might involve plumbers discussing the installation of
shower heads, or pet owners discussing their grievances with fur around
the house, or cancer patients sharing their insights into what it's like
to go through treatment at a certain stage.¬†

\

Focus groups are *not interviews* that happen to have multiple
respondents in the same room. Au contraire, the value of a focus group
lies in the group discussion, and the interactions that occur among the
members.

\

This method (which, as we'll discuss, has its detractors) is best used
to explore what people believe, how they feel, and what they perceive.¬†\

What is a focus group?
----------------------

A focus group is a moderated conversation with a group of 5 to 10
participants in which a moderator asks the group a set of questions
about a particular topic. They can be helpful tools for learning about
attitudes, beliefs, desires, and reactions to concepts or designs. Focus
groups typically last from 1 to 2 hours.

\

Because of their social dimension, focus groups can sometimes be more
effective at uncovering spontaneous reactions or ideas than 1:1 methods
like user interviews. However, there is a risk that participants might
influence each other or inhibit others from sharing honest thoughts or
feedback.¬†

\

Focus groups are traditionally used by social scientists seeking to
understand group dynamics, or by marketing researchers in order to
obtain feedback about a product or assess perceptions about a brand.

\

### What decisions do focus groups enable?

‚Äã‚ÄãFocus groups are used to inform vision and strategic decisions. They
provide clarity around a participant\'s big-picture beliefs and
philosophies in order to determine a potential company, product, or
service direction.

\

They can also be used to inform definition decisions, allowing you to
get early feedback on a potential design direction to determine if it's
worth additional investment or resourcing.

### What are the outputs?

Focus groups can generate a large amount of qualitative data, including
detailed notes, transcripts, audio, and video recordings.

\

All of this data is then synthesized into recommendations related to
potential product directions or opportunities.

\

### Benefits of focus groups as a UX research method

Focus groups are a good way to draw out ideas and information that
participants might not be willing or able to share in an interview
setting or through a survey.¬†

\

Being surrounded by a small group of peers makes many people more
comfortable and more willing to talk, even about sensitive or personal
topics.¬†

\

The interaction among group members can bring out ideas that were
previously not conscious, or simply taken for granted. The way group
members agree or disagree---either with passion or indifference---can
shed light on how important a certain consideration should or should not
be to your development team.

\

Why do some user researchers hate focus groups?
-----------------------------------------------

> "If I achieve one thing with my time here on earth, I might be content
> if that one thing could be burning to the ground the practice of
> running focus groups in place of actual user research." --- [Erika
> Hall](https://medium.com/mule-design/focus-groups-are-worthless-7d30891e58f1),
> Co-founder, Mule Design\

Some user researchers *really* dislike focus groups. And there are
plenty of reasons to be wary of this approach---it's certainly not a
method to use in isolation. Let's go over some of the commonly cited
drawbacks:

\

### Drawbacks and potential pitfalls¬†

‚Äç

#### 1. Focus groups tell you what people *say*, not what they do. 

> "The correlation between stated intent and actual behavior is usually
> low and negative."¬† --- Gerald Zaltman, *How Customers Think*\

Humans are notoriously bad at predicting their own behaviors,
remembering past events, and conceptualizing abstract ideas. There is a
large gap between what people say and what they do---and group dynamics
can further compound this fact of human nature. If you're trying to get
an accurate read on user behavior or customer purchasing intent, focus
groups are probably the wrong method.¬†

\

#### 2. Focus groups result in groupthink.

Focus groups trace their roots to the 1930s and 1940s, when they were
used by social scientists to study the effect of WWII propaganda.
Advertisers then adopted the method as a way to understand how consumers
think.

\

Focus groups are an effective way to study how individuals behave in a
group, and how group dynamics impact perceptions and decision-making. In
other words, focus groups are a useful tool for studying groups of
people.

\

What they are not good at is uncovering individual thoughts and
feelings. That's because focus groups lead to groupthink, a phenomenon
in which participants unconsciously conform to the opinion of the group
at large. Groupthink is a natural byproduct of group discussion---it's a
means of maintaining social harmony---but it means that focus groups
offer a skewed understanding of individual users' experiences.

\

#### 3. Dominant personalities overshadow other group members. 

We've all been in a meeting or classroom where one or two dominant
voices command the room. (If you can't remember such an occasion,
chances are good that you're one of those voices!)¬†

\

In a group setting, extroverts and contrarians can easily monopolize the
conversation. Sometimes this means literally talking over other people,
but it isn't always combative.

‚Äç

One or two influential participants often steer a discussion through the
strength of their thoughts and opinions. All it takes is one charming
and persuasive member to declare that wine from the Emilio-Romagna
region is the best wine and suddenly the whole group loves Lambrusco.
(And they would be right to do so, but that\'s beside the point.)

\

Your audience is likely a fairly even mix of introverts, extroverts, and
folks in the middle of the spectrum. But in a focus group, the voices of
quieter, more reserved personalities often go unheard. Again, if you're
hoping to learn about individuals, focus groups are not the right
method.

\

#### 4. It takes skill and experience to successfully moderate a focus group.

The success of a focus group depends heavily on the skill of the
moderator.

\

Group dynamics are tricky. No matter how diligently you prepare or how
thoroughly screen participants, bringing a group of people together is
always a gamble. Personalities might clash, leading to a conflict
between a couple of highly opinionated people. Or sometimes, like a bad
dinner party, there's just no group chemistry no matter how hard your
moderator might try.\

### How to mitigate common focus group problems¬†

‚Äç

#### Have participants actually *use* the product.

If you're conducting a focus group to understand user perceptions and
reactions to a product, give users an opportunity to interact with that
product. Feedback based on actual experience is more accurate and useful
than feedback based on hypothetical scenarios or out-of-context prompts.
Run individual usability tests *before* participants convene for a focus
group discussion.

\

#### Screen for introversion/extroversion.

Include questions in your screener survey that will help you identify
introverted and extroverted participants. Ask questions like "Does being
around other people give you energy?" and "Do you prefer to be with
other people or to be alone?"¬†

\

You might also conduct a screener call with participants to assess their
conversation style---do they dominate the call? How much prompting do
they need to provide detailed answers? Will their voice be drowned out
in a group?

¬†

It's impossible to predict how any group of people will interact when it
comes down to it, but you can do your best to create a balanced group
that won't feel like hostile territory for the introverts involved. You
might also consider conducting a group with *only* self-identified
introverts.

\

#### Try conducting video focus groups online.

Moving your focus groups to an online setting can mitigate the effects
of group dynamics. Seasoned user researcher [Jay Eskenazi
suggests](https://uxmag.com/articles/how-to-fix-the-5-most-common-mistakes-with-focus-groups)using
a platform that allows participants to share their responses with
moderators privately, before they see the responses of other group
members. This ensures that their responses are "uncontaminated by group
dynamics."¬†

When to use a focus group for UX research
-----------------------------------------

With so many cons and caveats, are focus groups ever worth it?¬†

\

They can be!

\

In fact, oftentimes the reason focus groups fail is because researchers
try to use them to answer the wrong questions or during the wrong stage
in product development.¬†

\

Focus groups are meant to uncover perceptions, not behaviors. Group
dynamics can be a great way to learn about perceptions because
conversations can reveal things that a one-on-one interview might not.

\

#### Use focus groups to:

-   Identify or clarify research questions during the earliest stages of
    a research project.
-   Gain insight into how people talk about a problem, product, or
    shared experience *in a group setting*.
-   Learn about users' opinions, attitudes, and preferences after they
    have used a prototype.

How to conduct a focus group
----------------------------

‚Äç

First things first:

‚Äç

#### What are your research goals?

As we discussed above, focus groups often fail because researchers use
them to answer the wrong types of research questions.¬†

\

Before you spend time and money on planning, recruiting, and conducting
a focus group study, make sure it's really the right method to meet your
needs! Remember: Focus groups can help you uncover perceptions and
opinions, not behaviors.¬†

\

Read the chapter on [**How to Create a User Research
Plan**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/create-user-research-plan)
for a step-by-step guide to coming up with effective research goals and
questions. A good research question is:¬†

-   Specific (so you'll know when you have found an answer)¬†
-   Practical (you can reasonably find answers in the scope of a
    research project)
-   Actionable (your team will be able to make decisions based on your
    learnings)

#### Where will the group meet?

If you're conducting a focus group online, your biggest logistical
considerations will be deciding on a platform, sending each participant
a link and instructions on how to join the group, and troubleshooting
any technical issues along the way.

\

For in-person focus groups, location plays a much larger role in the
planning process.

\

The decision is partially a matter of logistics---you need some place
everyone can get to, and you need a comfortable room of the right size
that is free of distracting noises. If you'd like to observe from behind
a two-way mirror, you'll want to invite participants to a lab (either
your own, or a [rented space](https://breather.com/)).¬†

\

Location can also impact group dynamics, and different people feel
comfortable in different kinds of places. For example, businesspeople
will find the conference room at a hotel comfortingly familiar, whereas
another group of participants might prefer a ring of folding chairs in a
space that feels like a church basement or a classroom.¬†

\

The question is: Under what circumstances do these people normally sit
around and talk about this subject? Try to mimic those circumstances as
closely as possible---nobody likes to feel like fish out of water.

\

**Always visit a location before to check:¬†**

-   Is the room easy to find? If not, find or create a map.
-   Is the building easy to find?
-   Is there affordable parking nearby?
-   Are there clean and accessible toilets onsite?
-   Does the building have an elevator?
-   Is the temperature comfortable? Is it air-conditioned or heated, as
    the case may be?
-   Is anything problematic likely to be happening in or near the venue
    during your group meeting? For example, is an unrelated convention
    likely to make the place confusing, crowded, or noisy? Is a sports
    game or college commencement nearby likely to snarl up traffic?

#### Who will moderate?

Focus groups require experienced moderators with strong [interviewing
skills](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews)and
the ability to bring a group back to center if things veer off course.
If a moderator is too passive, the group can get lost in its own
momentum and veer off topic. Too leading, and your results will be
skewed. Awkward, and the participants won't feel comfortable. Overly
confident, and they could be perceived as domineering and off putting.¬†

\

Good moderators have:

-   Some background knowledge or direct experience with the subject at
    hand
-   Energy and enthusiasm for the discussion
-   The ability to encourage quiet participants and rein in strong
    personalities
-   A good memory for names and details
-   Experience interviewing participants¬†

### Recruiting participants for a focus group

As with other research methods like user interviews, the first step of
recruitment involves identifying the participants you need.¬†

\

Ask yourself: Who can answer my research questions?

\

If you have a sense of your product's target personas, there may be an
opportunity to match your participants with those personalities.¬†

\

If you're in earlier stages of development, aim for a highly diverse
population within your product's target market. All sorts of people wear
sneakers, for example, so a focus group on sneakers would be very
diverse indeed: a whole spectrum of sneaker-wearers could be included. A
focus group on tie clips and cufflinks, on the other hand, might look a
bit more homogenous. If your target audience is tighter, you might need
fewer groups overall.

\

In either case, your focus group participants need to have something in
common in order for the discussion to provide you with actionable
insights.

‚Äç

When creating [screener
surveys](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/screener-surveys)
to filter for good-fit participants, always second-guess your
participant criteria: Does gender matter? Income? Education level? Race?
While demographics might influence the way people experience a product,
most of the time these factors *don't* prevent someone from being able
to answer your research question.¬†

\

If you're interested in how experiences differ across populations, you
can collect demographic data without screening on it.

\

Pro tip: Many recruiting services, including [User
Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/recruit), already collect
(with ¬†consent) data on participants about things like race, ethnicity,
income, education, and location. Unless you're filtering by one of these
factors, don't need to include these questions in your screener.\
\

#### How many groups do you need?

The more groups you have, the more ideas and opinions you will collect,
but this is helpful only up to a point. How many groups your study will
need depends on your budget, how many different varieties of
participants you want to include, and how many geographical areas you
want to cover.

\

Aim to recruit for 3 to 6 groups, depending on the requirements of your
study.

\

#### How many people do you need?

Group size affects the group dynamic. Too few people, and the discussion
won\'t take off. The meeting will function more like an interview with
multiple interviewees. Too many people, and not everyone will be heard.¬†

\

Focus groups typically involve 5 to 10 participants, although you can
conduct a focus group with as few as 3 participants. We don't recommend
going over 10, since not only will some participants be overlooked, but
also because larger focus groups tend to take more time and require more
effort from the moderator.

\

So, if you're conducting a study with 4 focus groups of 6 participants,
you'll need to budget for 24 participants overall.

\

#### Communications and consent¬†

Make it easy for participants to show up to your study. Send each
participant an email with the following key pieces of information:

-   Time and date---if doing remote research, make sure you give the
    time and date in your participant's time zone.
-   Location---include a map and directions or a link to a video call
    and instructions for joining.
-   Research topic---don't give too much information away, but do remind
    users what the research will be about.

\

Any research involving humans requires *informed* consent. Always take
care to explain to participants that you will be recording and
collecting data and how you plan to use it.¬† [Have them sign a
document](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/ndas-and-informed-consent-for-user-research),
written in plain language, confirming their consent. Repeat this
information at the outset of the session, and verify once again that
everyone is on the same page.¬†

‚Äç

#### Incentives

Pay your participants! (Or compensate them fairly another way, if
cash-based incentives aren't the right option for your audience.)¬†

\

We wrote a whole [chapter on UX research
incentives](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ux-research-incentives)
and even made [this handy incentive
calculator](https://www.userinterviews.com/lp/ux-research-incentive-calculator)
to help you figure out the right amount to offer people as a reward for
their time and expertise.¬†

\

On average, you should plan to compensate each participant at a rate of
\$100 per hour for in-person focus group studies or \$80 an hour for
online studies.¬†

\

If you're targeting professionals by industry, that rate goes up to
\$125 for an in-person study or \$100 for an online focus group.

### Moderating a focus group session

As Demetrius Madrigal and Bryan McClain write in
[UXmatters](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/07/dos-and-donts-for-focus-groups.php):

\

> "A good focus-group session flirts at the edge of chaos."

\

A moderator\'s job is not to ask questions and get answers the way an
interviewer does. Instead, facilitating a focus group involves using
questions, group exercises, and other techniques to get the discussion
going and keep it going.¬†

\

The trickiest part of moderating is making sure that everyone gets to
speak and that one or two dominant voices don't end up monopolizing the
conversation. It also takes great skill to keep a discussion on track
without seeming overbearing.

\

Nielsen Norman Group
[explains](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/focus-groups/):

\

> For participants, the focus-group session should feel free-flowing and
> relatively unstructured, but in reality, the moderator must follow a
> preplanned script of specific issues and set goals for the type of
> information to be gathered. During the group session, the moderator
> has the difficult job of keeping the discussion on track without
> inhibiting the flow of ideas and comments.

\

#### Best practices for moderating a focus group

-   The conversation should be both audio and video recorded, since
    group discussions are too complex for effective note-taking. Remind
    participants at the beginning of the session that they are being
    recorded.
-   Treat your discussion guide as just that---a guide---not a script.
    If you try sticking to a script, you'll likely find yourself at odds
    with the tone and flow of the conversation. As with one-on-one
    interviews, create a loose guide to help you stay on track, but
    don't expect to follow it by the letter.
-   Begin each session with a round of introductions. You first---tell
    participants a little bit about yourself, to model the kinds of
    answers you'd like to hear. You might also consider doing a couple
    brief warm up exercises unrelated to the topic at hand. Talking in a
    group can be intimidating (for some folks more than others) so give
    people a chance to loosen up before launching into the research.
-   Don't fly solo. Focus group sessions should only have one moderator
    (otherwise things can get messy, fast). But that doesn't mean you
    have to handle everything on your own. Ask a member of your team to
    help by taking notes, keeping an eye on the time, and being a second
    pair of eyes and ears.
-   Be aware of who the dominant group members are---people with strong
    personalities who have an outsized influence on the conversation. If
    it seems like one or two participants are getting all the airtime,
    be prepared to politely but firmly redirect the discussion to
    another participant.¬†

#### How to write a focus group discussion guide¬†

Writing a focus group discussion guide is, in many ways, similar to
writing an interview guide. The difference, of course, is that you're
writing questions that will be answered by multiple people in the same
session and that will, ideally, spark conversations in which you become
an active observer.

\

[As with user
interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews),
think of your list of discussion questions as a guide, not a script.
Keep your list of must-asks brief---otherwise you may not get to them
all.¬†

\

Try to anticipate how the conversation might go. Participants might have
difficulty answering a certain question, or you may be eager to dig
deeper into a topic if the conversation allows. Create a list of
followup questions in case you need them.¬†

\

Although it's impossible to predict how any discussion will play out, do
your best to anticipate moments where you might need to rein things back
in. Be prepared by coming up with a game plan and a few key phrases for
dealing with different types of disruptions.

\

A few more rules of thumb for writing focus group questions:

-   Don't ask about hypothetical scenarios---focus on direct (past)
    experiences, perceptions, and opinions.¬†
-   Keep things open-ended. Yes/no questions can quickly kill the flow
    of a conversation.
-   Avoid leading questions that hint at the "correct" answer.

‚Äç

#### Sample focus group questions for UX research

‚Äç

**Warm up questions**

Always open with some getting-to-know-you questions. Keep things light,
and let participants get comfortable with each other.¬†

-   What did you do last weekend?
-   What do you do for work?
-   What's your favorite time of day?

\

**Discovery and context of use questions**

When you're conducting a focus group to gain a broad understanding of
participant motivations, needs, and opinions in order to generate ideas.

-   Tell us a story about the last time you used/did \[X\].
-   What is the hardest part about being a \[persona attribute\]?
-   Think about the last time you did/used \[X\]. How did you feel?

\

**Usability and interaction questions**

If you're conducting a focus group after usability testing to gather
feedback on a prototype or product, ask open-ended questions like:

-   How would you describe the onboarding experience of this app?
-   What frustrated you the most about this experience?¬†
-   Which version of the support page did you find easier to navigate
    and why?
-   Did anything distract you or get in the way of completing \[task\]?

\

**Opinion questions**

To understand participants' opinions about a design or experience and
evaluate how pleasing (or not) it is.

-   How would you describe this product?
-   Can you think of any similar products that you've used in the past?
    How do they compare?
-   What changes would make this product more appealing?

‚Äç

#### Focus group activities

Focus groups can involve activities as well as the standard question and
answer format. You might try working in one of these activities to add
variety to the session and generate additional artifacts.

\

Group activities ideas for focus groups include:

-   Drawing pictures
-   Fill-in-the-blank worksheets
-   Word associations
-   Card sorting
-   List making
-   Role-playing
-   Answering imaginative questions like "\"if our product were a
    person, what would they be like?\"

Analyzing focus group data
--------------------------

Analyzing focus group discussion data can be difficult, in part because
there is so much of it. Transcripts alone can run to dozens of pages.

\

Generally, the [analysis
process](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/research-analysis-synthesis)
must include both the video and the transcript, in order to capture
non-verbal communication and in order to eliminate confusion over who
said what. You'll also likely find yourself referring back to the
session notes taken by your partner.

‚Äç

#### Focus group note taking tips to make analysis easier

Focus groups produce a lot of data, and session recordings can be
difficult to wade through without supplementary notes. Ask your partner
to take notes during the session so you can focus on moderating the
discussion. Have them:\

-   Draw a **seating chart** to show where each participant sat during
    the exercise
-   **Record observations** about group dynamics, body language, and
    other things that might not be obvious from an audio recording or
    transcript.
-   Write down **key points and themes** that come out of each question.
-   Try to tag and **code notes** as you go---this will save your team
    time at the end and make it easier to identify patterns in the data
    as they emerge.
-   Capture interesting quotes---including who said what and when. As
    much as possible, try to **record the time** that things happened,
    to make it easier to find that moment in your recordings.\

### How to analyze focus group notes and deliverables

‚Äç

#### Review your notes after each session

Immediately after each focus group session, revisit your discussion
guide and try to recall the responses, trends, and questions that arose
from each topic. Use this time to review session notes and any
participant-created materials while your memory is fresh.

\

Since focus group studies produce *so much* data from so many different
people, it is useful to write up a simple report or summary after each
session.¬†

‚Äç

#### Use qualitative coding to tabulate the data

Use qualitative data coding to tag the artifacts from each session.
Ideally, you (or your notetaker) will have done some preliminary data
coding in real-time. If not, don't wait until the end of a study---code
your notes and artifacts after each session. If you've been tagging
things as you go, revisit your notes at the end of a study to clean up
your tags.¬† Consult audio or video recordings if something is unclear.

\

Once all your data has been coded, you'll be able to organize, tabulate,
and analyze patterns and themes by descriptive stats like frequency and
percentage.

‚Äç

#### Analyze focus group data

Analyzing focus group data involves analyzing each session individually,
and then analyzing those reports again in a meta-analysis of key
insights and themes.

\

Themes or categories that you might use include:

-   Likes and dislikes
-   Emotive words
-   Mental models
-   Problems/issues
-   Ideas/opportunities

\

When analyzing focus group data, ask yourself:

-   What **words** did people use to talk about a product or experience?
-   Was the participant passionate, happy, angry, etc? What was the
    **intensity of feeling** behind a response?
-   What comments/words/responses occurred most often (**frequency**)?
-   How often did **individual participants** speak? Which participants,
    if any, dominated the discussion?¬†
-   What was the **context** for particular responses? What triggered
    strong feelings?

Sharing your findings
---------------------

It's easy to get bogged down in focus group data. Remember that the
value of focus groups lies in their ability to reveal big-picture,
qualitative information about *people*. Keep that in mind as you run
your analysis. And as always, use your initial research questions as a
guide to analyzing the data.

\

Similarly, don't try to include every single observation, quote, or
insight in your research report. Keep your deliverables focused on the
key insights, themes, and takeaways that relate back to your study
goals.¬†

\

If your focus groups involve group activities, including the outputs of
these activities can help illustrate your final report. As with
interviews, sharing video clips and key quotes can help stakeholders
connect with the data in your report. But remember that it's your job as
a researcher to help people make sense of the research---whenever you
include things like participant-made artifacts or quotations, always
contextualize the information for people who weren't in the room.

\

Tools for conducting focus groups
---------------------------------

Focus groups require recording equipment, first and foremost. You will
definitely want to review footage later. If you are conducting an
in-person focus group, this will involve a video camera (or several) and
a good mic.¬†

\

For remote focus groups, you'll need a video conferencing tool like
[Zoom](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/zoom-user-interviews-integration-making-your-workflow-way-easier),
or a specialized solution like one of the ones listed below.

\

You will also need:

    low-cost option)
-   Software for [transcribing your
    recordings](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/user-research-recordings-analysis)
-   And a tool for organizing and analyzing your data.

Hybrid research: Combining focus groups with other methods¬†
-----------------------------------------------------------

Focus groups are rarely used alone, even if the goals of the research
are entirely qualitative.
[Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews),
for example, are another qualitative research approach that can be used
to drill into some of the more micro details (the "whys") that focus
groups aren't designed to answer.¬†¬†¬†

\

Alternatively, a focus group study can be used to develop the parameters
of a quantitative study, such as a survey. On the flip side, you might
conduct a focus group as a follow up to a survey.

\

Yes, designing a terrible focus group is easy
---------------------------------------------

But that doesn't mean its inevitable! Focus groups get a bad rap.¬†

\

It *is* easy to screw this method up. (If you're determined to do so, we
actually wrote a handy guide on [How to Conduct a Terrible Focus Group
Study for UX
Research.](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/how-to-conduct-a-terrible-focus-group-study-for-ux-research))
But most of the time, focus groups fail because researchers are using
them to answer the wrong questions.¬†

\

So long as they're used for the right reasons and moderated by a skilled
and experienced user researcher (like yourself!), focus groups still
deserve a place in the UX research toolkit.\

You can't build buildings without a solid foundation. Likewise, you
can't build products without a solid, research-based information
architecture---and one of the most popular methods for testing and
validating your information architecture is **card sorting**.¬†

‚Äç

Card sorting is a cost-effective way to learn how participants
understand, group, and categorize specific information. With this
insight, you can build easy-to-navigate structures for your products and
websites---by putting the "contact" button wherever users would
intuitively search for the "contact" button, for example.

‚Äç

Here, you'll find everything you need to know to put this research
method into action.¬†

In this chapter:
----------------

-   What is card sorting?
-   When to use card sorting for UX research
-   How to conduct a card sort study
-   Analyzing and sharing card sorting results
-   Card sorting tools and templates
-   Hybrid research: Combining card sorting with other methods

What is card sorting?
---------------------

Card sorting is a research method in which participants group topics
together in a way that makes sense to them. Typically, UX researchers
conduct card sorts by writing topics on individual cards, asking users
to sort related topics into groups, and then asking users to name or
categorize each group.¬†

‚Äç

[Card
sorting](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/first-click-testing)
provides visibility into a user's mental model, their thought process
about how something works, or---more to the point---how they think it
*should* work. Using these mental models helps UX and product designers
build more intuitive, easy-to-navigate¬† information architecture.¬†

‚Äç

Here's an example of what a physical card sort might look like, from
[Product Designer Andrej
Dragisic](https://uxplanet.org/improving-information-architecture-through-card-sorting-730a66b7bdda):¬†

![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/6217aa36796cc6a4a6dd7093_k3GwWtPvFChhkxtB7w44jdrVT28PH-fi5g_GbNUjo98dHNTjRTthE1r31wx2PFvJryHTVpm4eOv3XDTqmE9b-jR6u2ysVt_KuNdYcswlMjLiklGanCaLPwC0zO7NMaqt-vzKGaXQ.png)

As you can see, the cards are grouped together into like categories:
Dental, hair care, lotion, and soap. Conducted with only notecards,
sticky notes, and a marker, card sorts like this one are relatively
quick, easy, and inexpensive.¬†

‚Äç

Although card sorting is most commonly used to explore and inform the IA
of websites and apps, it does have other uses.
[IBM](https://medium.com/design-ibm/card-sorting-a-powerful-simple-research-method-9d1566be9b62),
for instance, uses card sorting to prompt study participants to tell a
story, establish a multi-level hierarchy, and define priorities.¬†¬†

### There are three types of card sorts:

-   **Open card sorts:** Users sort cards into groups, and then name the
    groups. This is¬† the most common type of card sorting exercise, and
    is especially helpful at the beginning of a project when you're
    trying to get insight into how people categorize and label
    information.¬†
-   **Closed card sorts:** Users sort cards into an existing set of
    categories. This approach is typically used later in a project as a
    way of validating whether or not category labels make sense to
    users.¬†
-   **Hybrid card sorts:** Similar to a closed card sort, except users
    can also create new categories. Hybrid card sorting exercises are
    often used on redesign projects, because this approach allows the
    researcher to see how participants engage with existing information
    architecture while leaving space to explore additional categories
    that might make sense as part of an update.¬†

### Card sorting vs. tree testing

Card sorting is most often used as an initial step to help determine the
most user-friendly structure for a website or product. Tree testing, on
the other hand, is sometimes called 'backwards card sorting' because it
involves showing the participant the existing information architecture
and then observing the click path they take to accomplish a specific
goal.¬†

‚Äç

Card sorting helps you create the trees you test in tree testing. Read
the [Tree Testing
Chapter](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/tree-testing)
to learn more.¬†

### Advantages and disadvantages of card sorting

No [user research
method](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/how-to-choose-a-research-method)
is perfect. Here are some of the pros and cons of card sorting to take
into consideration when planning your study.

‚Äç

Benefits **of card sorting:¬†**

-   **Straightforward:** Card sorting is a simple exercise that's
    relatively easy for researchers to organize and for study
    participants and stakeholders to understand.
-   **Inexpensive:** Whether you're going old school with index cards
    and sticky notes or using a digital tool, card sorts are typically a
    lower-cost research method.
-   **Efficient:** Card sorting delivers a useful amount of data over a
    short period of time.
-   **User-based:** Card sorting delivers highly relevant insights based
    on real user input.
-   **Foundational:** Card sorting provides important user-based
    guidance on how to structure a website or product.

‚Äç

**Potential drawbacks of card sorting:¬†**

-   **Content-centric:** Because card sorting is focused on content
    rather than action, there is a risk it may define an information
    structure that is not effective for users once they are completing
    actual tasks.
-   **Inconsistent:** The nature of card sorting means that your results
    may vary quite widely from one participant to the next.
-   **Time-consuming analysis:** While the actual card sorting exercise
    is quick to run, analyzing the data can take more time, in part
    because of the potential inconsistency in responses. (Some digital
    card sorting tools mitigate this drawback with built-in analysis.)
-   **Limited depth:** Since card sorting focuses on labels and
    high-level categorization and organization, it won't provide
    feedback on how users perceive the actual content or how it relates
    to real-world tasks.¬†

When to use card sorts for UX research
--------------------------------------

Card sorting is a
[generative](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/discovery-methods)
(rather than an
[evaluative](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/evaluative-methods))
research method. It cannot tell you what is wrong with an existing site
or product. Instead, card sorting is most useful at the beginning stages
of a project, such as designing a wholly new product or redesigning an
existing website.

‚Äç

Card sorting can help you understand your target users' mental models so
you can:

-   **Identify** how people classify different ideas, topics, and
    concepts.
-   **Determine** how people organize specific items such as icons,
    images, and menu items.
-   **Compare** how different groups (end users vs. administrators, for
    instance) organize the same information.
-   **Reveal** themes and patterns from qualitative data.

‚Äç

Insights gained from card sorting help you design better user
experiences by giving you the information you need to tailor the UI to
meet their expectations.

How to conduct a card sort study
--------------------------------

The early steps in [the user research
process](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-process-fundamentals)
are similar no matter which method you choose. It always starts with
[creating a user research
plan](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/create-user-research-plan),
outlining your research goals, related company goals, baseline
assumptions and hypotheses, and
more.[](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/planning-user-research)

‚Äç

[Check out Chapter 2 of the Field Guide to read in-depth on planning
user
research.](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/planning-user-research)

### Prepare ahead of time.¬†

There are three steps you need to take before you can use card sorting
effectively:

1.  **Create a user research plan** to outline the what, why, and how of
    your study. This ensures an intentional approach to research,
    [informed by stakeholder
    interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/internal-stakeholder-interviews)
    and enabling relevant company decisions.¬†
2.  **Get a handle on your content and/or functionality.** Do an audit
    to get a detailed inventory of existing assets, or create a detailed
    list of proposed content and functionality for a new site or
    product.
3.  **Select the session topic** based on your review of user goals and
    existing or planned content/functionality.

### Choose your card sorting methods.

The type of card sort you choose will depend on your research goals and
the kind of information you're hoping to learn. There are a variety of
options to consider, including:

-   Open card sorts vs. closed card sorts.
-   Team card sorts vs. individual card sorts.
-   Moderated card sorts vs. unmoderated card sorts.
-   In-person card sorts vs. remote card sorts.¬†

Let's explore the right use cases for each.¬†

‚Äç

#### Open card sorts vs. closed card sorts

Open card sorts, in which users sort cards into groups and then
categorize the groups, are the most common type of card sorting study.
In closed card sorts, users organize the cards into predefined
categories.¬†

-   Use open card sorts when you want to **learn** how users group
    information and the terminology they use to categorize that
    information.¬†
-   Use closed card sorts when you want to **validate** the clarity and
    effectiveness of an existing set of categories, or when you need to
    know where to place new content within an existing category
    structure.¬†

Many researchers choose to use a combination of both open and closed
card sorts, to first identify category labels and then determine whether
or not those labels are effective.¬†

‚Äç

#### Team card sorts vs. individual card sorts

Card sorts can be completed by teams or by individuals. In [*Card
Sorting --- Designing Usable
Categories*,](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Card-Sorting-Excerpt.pdf)
Donna Spencer highlights the benefits of team card sorts as a way to
capture a wealth of layered insight:

‚Äç

"During the card sort, the participants talk about what they are doing,
argue about where various cards go, discuss different ways to group the
cards, query what the content means, and talk about how they might use
the content. This discussion is incredibly valuable---in many cases, the
discussion is more valuable than the outcome of the card sort."

‚Äç

This discussion helps illuminate the participants' mental models,
because they have to communicate their thought processes and defend
their choices. Spencer finds individual card sorts to be a great way to
capture a large number of responses quickly and efficiently, but notes
that this approach---even when researchers ask participants to "think
aloud" as they work---doesn't deliver the same depth of insight as a
team sort.

‚Äç

Of course, in any group dynamic, you run the risk of one dominant
personality taking over or groupthink delivering a less-than-clear
outcome. (Groupthink is a commonly cited pitfull of focus groups, which
we cover in [this
chapter](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/focus-groups).)¬†

‚Äç

Whether you choose team, individual, or a combination of the two
methods, it's important to observe the process directly so you can see
for yourself how the process flows.¬†¬†¬†

‚Äç\

#### Moderated card sorts vs. unmoderated card sorts

In a moderated card sort, researchers are able to ask follow-up
questions to dig deeper into participants' choices. Unmoderated card
sorts are typically faster and less expensive to run, but don't allow
for this in-the-moment clarification.

‚Äç

**Moderated card sorts**

-   Usually more expensive and time-consuming.
-   Requires more coordination.
-   Allows for user "narration" of sorting choices to provide additional
    visibility into their thought process.
-   Provides the option for a debrief, which allows you to ask follow-up
    questions and capture qualitative insights.
-   Requires additional time and resources for data analysis.

‚Äç

**Unmoderated card sorts**

-   Tends to be faster and less expensive.
-   Fairly easy to organize.
-   May provide shallower qualitative insights.
-   Often used as a complement to moderated sessions.

‚Äç

When choosing between moderated, unmoderated, or a combination of the
two, you'll need to balance the depth of insight you're looking for with
your available time and resources.¬†

‚Äç

#### In-person card sorts vs. remote card sorts

In-person card sorts use traditional, paper cards while remote card
sorts use digital, online tools. There are pros and cons to both
methods:

‚Äç

**Paper card sorts**

-   More flexible and forgiving for the user.
-   Allows the user to see all content in one place.
-   No technology learning curve.
-   In-person sessions require more coordination.
-   Requires manual documentation and analysis.

‚Äç

**Digital card sorts**

-   Uses digital cards in an online tool.
-   Can require quick technology training.
-   Fast and easy to coordinate and implement.
-   Software captures input and automates analysis.

‚Äç

Because digital card sorts are faster and easier to implement, they're
ideal for small, resource-constrained teams---or remote teams, which at
this point is most of us.

### Choose the right content and create your cards.

Getting relevant, in-depth results from a card sort depends, in large
part, on picking the right cards for the exercise.¬†¬†¬†

‚Äç

**How many cards should you include in a card sort?**

‚Äç

With card sorting, more is not always better. In fact, too many cards
can overwhelm participants, causing them to burn out toward the end of
the exercise. Most experts recommend using between 30 and 60 cards, with
40 cards being the sweet spot.¬†

‚Äç

Tips for creating the most effective set of cards include:

-   **Exclude "gimme" cards that don't add much value.** This includes
    well-known, persistent items like "site map" or "home."
-   **Consolidate into representative cards.** You don't need a card for
    every single page in a category. The goal is simply to have enough
    cards to represent the different classes of information within a
    category.
-   **Ensure there are enough cards to form groupings*.*** Include two
    or more of each card type so that it's possible for participants to
    sort them into natural groups.¬†¬†

It's important to note that just because you're aiming to ultimately end
up with 30 to 60 cards doesn't mean you can't start with a whole lot
more options. In fact, it's best to curate as robust a list as possible
when you're getting started, and then cull the list down through careful
evaluation.¬†

‚Äç

Information architect and digital experience designer, Andy Fitzgerald,
has a helpful post that outlines a[collaborative method for choosing
topics](https://www.andyfitzgeraldconsulting.com/writing/choosing-card-sorting-topics/).
He recommends this approach because it's a great way to access multiple
viewpoints, gain additional insights, and generate buy-in from both
project teammates and clients. It can also be a really fun activity!¬†

‚Äç

#### Avoid patterns and bias when writing cards

It's surprisingly easy to insert unintended bias into your cards. You
can avoid this by removing cues that suggest patterns or hierarchy.¬†

-   **Be careful about how you use upper and lower case. ** Differences
    in case can cause participants to ascribe greater importance to
    capitalized items.
-   **Avoid labels with parallel construction. ** For example instead of
    "Resources --- online" and "Resources --- offline" you might have
    "Resources --- online" and "Offline resources."
-   **Make good use of synonyms. ** Even if the construction is
    different, using the same word in multiple cards can cause
    participants to automatically group those cards together. The
    thesaurus is your friend.¬†

‚Äç

#### Keep the level of granularity consistent

Stick to a consistent level of granularity rather than including
multiple layers of parent and child categories. Mixing headings with the
card set can be confusing for participants and skew results in unhelpful
ways.

‚Äç

#### Be careful with your choice of words¬†

Make it easy for participants to quickly grasp the meaning of a card
without any guesswork by making labels brief but specific. Use
terminology that is familiar to participants and that reflects their
perception of the content rather than internal labels and concepts.

### Recruit the right participants.

The success of any UX research study depends on the quality of the
participants you recruit---but finding and [recruiting the right
participants](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/find-good-research-participants)
isn't easy.¬†

‚Äç

#### **What kind of participants do you need?**¬†

For best results, you need to recruit people who accurately represent
the real-life users who will eventually be using your website or
product.¬†

‚Äç

Depending on the nature of what you're trying to learn, it may be
helpful to include both "experienced" and "inexperienced" users in the
mix. This could mean [recruiting and managing a panel of your own
customers](https://www.userinterviews.com/research-hub) (more likely for
closed or hybrid card sorts, where you already have an existing IA) or
[recruiting outside
participants](https://www.userinterviews.com/recruit) who've never used
your product before (more likely for open card sorts).¬†

‚Äç

#### **How do you find the right participants?¬†**

You can find research participants by putting out calls for participants
on social media, reaching out to your email list, or using [UX research
recruitment
tools](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/ux-research-tools-map-2021)
like [User
Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/lp/rorpaccount?promo_code=3FREE&source=navbarSignup).
Be sure to design an effective [screener
survey](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/screener-surveys)
to weed out unqualified participants and [offer fair
incentives](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ux-research-incentives)
to thank participants and discourage no-shows.¬†

‚Äç

If you're not sure what a fair incentive looks like for a particular
study, use our handy [UX Research Incentives
Calculator](https://www.userinterviews.com/lp/ux-research-incentive-calculator)
to get a data-backed recommendation.¬†

‚Äç

#### **How many participants do you need to recruit?**¬†

[Nielsen Norman
Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-how-many-users-to-test/)
recommends recruiting at least 15 people for the typical card sorting
study, based on [research published in
2004](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254164354_How_Many_Users_Are_Enough_for_a_Card-Sorting_Study)
by Dr. Thomas S. Tullis, senior VP of human interface design at Fidelity
Investments, and co-author Larry Wood. For well-funded, high-stakes
research, you could recruit up to 30 participants, but any more than
that will likely have diminishing returns.¬†

‚Äç

Field Guide, Recruiting for UX
Research.](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/recruiting)

### Facilitate and record the session.

If you are doing a moderated card sort, your goal is to maintain
momentum and observe without accidentally leading the participant. A
moderator should take care to give each participant equal opportunity to
provide input. This is especially important in team card sort exercises
in which a dominant personality can have undue influence. Take notes
throughout the session to capture insightful comments, questions, and
your own observations.¬†

‚Äç

It's also always helpful to record each session so that you can look
back later to make sure you didn't miss any details or patterns in the
process. This can help you in analyzing data as well.

Analyzing and sharing card sorting results
------------------------------------------

Analyzing the data from a card sort can be challenging, especially if
your study includes a large number of participants working with a
substantial number of cards. Finding meaningful patterns in the data can
be quite time-consuming and usually involves advanced techniques like
cluster analysis and dendrograms.¬†

‚Äç

Even when researchers are adept with the relevant types of analysis, the
analytical output can be difficult for clients and other non-experts to
grasp. To overcome this hurdle, Shanshan Ma, a principal UX designer,
developed a [quick-and-dirty analysis
method](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/09/dancing-with-the-cards-quick-and-dirty-analysis-of-card-sorting-data.php)
that uses spreadsheets to visually represent card-sorting data.

‚Äç

Here's an example from the article:

‚Äç

![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/6217aac80f3be23d9703dbea_fXzXXPt7JfKOU9Bukup7quFpzFDIbN-rOrZFWiqPdLUhmMEJX2SuGK3Tqen6Buht6LwT1t3H1JP6dCz9eqQuKOiiPxT4mMfXpOY5Ms1d-7B4gznRPUfrXYwRnBPxLsz_Xq0OKeQX.png)

‚Äç

Her process includes six steps:

-   **Step 1:** Identify the common categories.
-   **Step 2:** Create a matrix with the categories across the top and
    the cards down the side, and then input the raw numbers indicating
    how many participants grouped each card in each category.
-   **Step 3:** Replace the raw participant counts with percentages, and
    then isolate the truly meaningful selections by deleting all
    percentages below a certain threshold.¬†
-   **Step 4:** Group the cards based on which cards have the highest
    percentages among all of the groups.¬†
-   **Step 5:** Analyze the distribution of percentages on a
    group-by-group basis, and consider why participants made these
    selections.
-   **Step 6:** Make your decisions about how to place and crosslink
    each piece of content, as well as where it makes sense to duplicate
    content.

Hybrid research: Combining card sorting with other methods
----------------------------------------------------------

As with any other kind of UX research, combining card sorting with other
methods is the best way to get the most complete and accurate picture.
Because card sorts are generative, they are typically done early in the
process, and are often followed by [evaluative tree
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/tree-testing).
You can also uncover additional valuable data by adding [user
interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews)
or
[surveys](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/surveys)
