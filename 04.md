
UX Research Methodologies
=========================

There are so many different types of user research---and so many
methodologies and approaches in each category---that it's easy to get
overwhelmed by choice, even for experienced UX researchers!

This module is all about the different user research methodologies and
when to use them. We'll cover:

-   **The types of UX research methods**. You'll learn about the
    differences between different kinds of user research
    methods---quantitative and qualitative, generative and evaluative,
    attitudinal and behavioral, moderated and unmoderated.
-   **Qualitative vs. quantitative research** in more depth, including
    the differences in research design, sampling, data analysis, and how
    to combine them in mixed methods studies.
-   **How to choose a user research method** based on where you are in
    the product development cycle, your research goals, the kinds of
    data you need, and other factors.
-   **User research frameworks**, including our Decision Driven Research
    framework for mapping your methods to the kinds of decisions you
    want to enable.

In the previous chapters, we've covered the [fundamentals of UX
research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/user-research-fundamentals),
gone over how to [create a user research
plan](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/planning-user-research),
and went over a foolproof [framework for user research
recruiting](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/recruiting).

At this point, you're probably brimming with all the essential knowledge
and feeling ready to actually, y'know, do some user research.

But before we get into the individual methods (which we will, in depth),
it's worth taking time to review the different types of UX research
methods at your disposal. Because there are a lot of different types of
user research. 

Many methods are best suited to a particular scenario. Some only work
well when combined with other, specifically complementary methods. And
almost all deliver more valuable results when they are part of a
comprehensive hybrid research strategy. 

That's why, before you dive into the trenches, it's helpful to take a
step back and look at some of the broader categories that define
different types of user research. 

This chapter provides the 30,000-foot view that gives you the overall
lay of the land complete with the terms and topics that will help you
decide which research method is best for your project. 

Let's get to it.

### In this chapter:

-   Qualitative vs. quantitative methods
-   Generative vs. evaluative methods
-   Attitudinal vs. behavioral methods
-   Remote vs. in-person user research 
-   Moderated vs. unmoderated methods
-   Which user research method should you use?

Qualitative vs. quantitative user research methods
--------------------------------------------------

The primary differences between qualitative and quantitative UX research
have to do with how the data is collected and the nature of the data
itself. 

**Qualitative UX research** typically involves collecting data through
direct observation of a small group of people in order to assess
behavior and answer the question: "Why?" Common qualitative research
methods include interviews, focus groups, field studies, usability
tests, and co-design sessions.

**Quantitative UX research**, on the other hand, usually involves
collecting data from a much larger group of people in order to quantify
a problem by answering the questions, "How much?" and "How many?" Common
quantitative research methods include usability studies, surveys, click
tests, card sorts, and A/B tests.

Which type of method you choose depends on the kind of question you're
asking. The qualitative and quantitative data produced by each type of
research has unique strengths and weaknesses. 

**Quantitative data** provides very clear and unambiguous information
about variables like how much, how many, and how often. The numerical
nature of the data makes it easier to analyze, but it can also lack
context. For example, while quantitative research can tell you fairly
quickly and easily how often a set of users performs a particular task,
that information is only valuable if you also have the context to judge
whether that rate of task performance is good or bad. 

**Qualitative data** is more challenging to analyze and interpret. It is
presented in the form of unstructured or semi-structured observational
findings like comments, preferences, and motivations. While this kind of
data usually contains the context, it doesn't offer a black-and-white
output, relying instead on researcher interpretation. It does, however,
help identify root causes of behaviors, which then makes it easier to
develop appropriate solutions. 

The two types of data may seem worlds apart, but they are actually
highly complementary. When in doubt, mix methods for a more holistic
view of the problem you're trying to solve.

 As for whether it's a good idea to skip the qualitative bit and lean
into the statistics, well, [Jakob Nielsen of Nielsen Norman
Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/risks-of-quantitative-studies/)
had a few things to say about that:

> "Quantitative studies must be done exactly right in every detail or
> the numbers will be deceptive. There are so many pitfalls that you\'re
> likely to land in one of them and get into trouble.
> If you rely on numbers without insights, you don\'t have backup when
> things go wrong. You\'ll stumble down the wrong path, because that\'s
> where the numbers will lead.
> Qualitative studies are less brittle and thus less likely to break
> under the strain of a few methodological weaknesses. Even if your
> study isn\'t perfect in every last detail, you\'ll still get mostly
> good results from a qualitative method that relies on understanding
> users and their observed behavior."

### Types of qualitative research 

The various qualitative research methods can be further categorized into
5 main research types: \

1.  Ethnographic---observation of study participants in their natural
    environment to gain a better understanding of context, cultural
    insights, and participant's day-to-day lives.
2.  Narrative---in-depth research (typically interviews) with a small
    number of people to uncover narrative themes that illustrate how
    various factors can affect events and relationships.
3.  Phenomenological---a variety of tactics (interviews, observation,
    documentation, etc.) used to describe and interpret a specific
    phenomenon or event, including participant perceptions and
    motivations.
4.  Grounded theory---long-term, in-depth research to discover the
    social and psychological processes behind an event or situation,
    including its causes.
5.  Case studies---a detailed accounting, either explanatory or
    exploratory, of an individual, organization, or event that reflects
    how things happen in the real world.

**Note:** That's a good, concise overview of the differences between
qualitative and quantitative research. If you're looking for a deeper
dive into the whole quant/qual thing, never fear---we've written [a
whole chapter on the
subject.](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/qualitative-vs-quantitative-vs-mixed-methods)

Generative vs. evaluative user research methods
-----------------------------------------------

The primary differences between generative and evaluative UX research
have to do with *when* the data is collected and why. Generative methods
help you identify opportunities and ideas, while evaluative or
evaluation research methods help you figure out if your existing
solution is on the right track. 

**Generative research** (sometimes called foundational, exploratory, or
(as in this Field Guide) [**discovery
research**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/discovery-methods))
helps researchers gain a deep and highly detailed understanding of the
audience, the market, and even internal project goals. It does a lot
more than simply describe a user persona---it gets into the nitty-gritty
of the real-world person who may eventually become a user. Generative
research uses direct observation, deep inquiry, and careful analysis to
develop a fully rounded, 360-degree understanding of the human beings in
question---who they are, what their experiences are like (in relation to
a product and to life in general), what they care about, what they
believe in, how they think about the world, what drives their behavior
and decisions.

The goal of discovery research is to unearth opportunities to innovate
new solutions that will meet a specific and real need in the market.
Without this, it's all too easy to head off and develop a product no one
wants. 

**Evaluative research** is used to evaluate people's responses to a
product or solution. It comes into play a little later in the product
development process, but not that much later. Evaluative methods can
deliver valuable insights as soon as you have an initial concept (even
just a rough sketch or representative prototype), and should be used
throughout the design and development process as a kind of reality
check. Continuously putting design iterations in front of the relevant
audience for feedback helps ensure that the final product delivers the
experience people want while providing the solution they need.

Used together, generative and evaluative methods are like two sides of
the same coin. One side helps you identify and define the problem you
need to solve, while the other side makes sure you're building the right
solution to meet the need.

### Discovery (generative) methods

[Generative research
methods](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/discovery-methods)
include things like [stakeholder
interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/internal-stakeholder-interviews)
to uncover internal goals, [field
studies](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/field-studies)
to provide real-life context, and in-depth [user
interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews).

Each of these methods uses a combination of first-hand observation, deep
inquiry, and data analysis to ensure you're building the right product
at the right time for the right audience. Generative research methods
often allow researchers to observe every aspect of a study participant's
engagement---verbal responses, actions, behavior, body language, and so
forth. Researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the preferences
and mental models by asking follow-up questions to uncover the "why"
behind certain choices and behaviors. Any data---qualitative or
quantitative---is [analyzed to reveal relevant
patterns](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/research-analysis)
in the responses.

### Evaluative methods

There are a wide range of evaluative research methods, many of which are
most valuable at specific stages of development. Their purpose is to
validate whether or not your in-progress design is effectively solving
the problem you identified during your generative research.

[Evaluative
methods](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/evaluative-methods)
employ many different approaches---from [tree
testing](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/tree-testing)
to [qualitative usability
testing](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/qualitative-usability-testing),
accessibility testing, [A/B
testing](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/a-b-testing),
and more---to determine what is and isn't working in a design.  

##### 📖 **Read more about** [**Evaluative Research Methods**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/evaluative-methods)

### Continuous research methods

Research doesn't end once you've launched. In fact, it's incredibly
important to engage in ongoing listening and dialog with users using
methods like NPS and other [feedback
surveys](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/continuous-user-feedback-surveys),
[product
analytics](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-analytics),
as well as [customer
support](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/integrating-support-sales-and-product-feedback)
and feedback channels. Keeping the lines open is a critical part of
sustaining your product's value to users over the long term. 

Not only do [continuous research
methods](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/continuous-research-methods)
give you your first look at how people experience your product in real
life, they also help you adapt and evolve as things change. (And things
*will* change---maintaining an ongoing conversation and really listening
will help ensure that you don't get left behind.)

Attitudinal vs. behavioral user research methods
------------------------------------------------

We know it's shocking, but people often say one thing and do another.
The disparity is usually unintentional, which is one of the reasons it's
so important to use UX research methods that collect both behavioral and
attitudinal data. 

**Attitudinal research methods** rely on self-reported data. This means
that they reflect people's stated beliefs, perceptions, and
expectations. This category includes things like interviews, surveys,
[focus
groups](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/focus-groups),
and card sorts---all of which ask study participants to tell researchers
what they think.

The insights from attitudinal research methods are valuable, but they
also need to be taken with a grain of salt. People sometimes fall short
of telling you what they really think or are unable to fully articulate
their perceptions. And even when they think they are telling you the
whole truth and nothing but the truth, it can turn out that their
expectations don't match up with reality. (This is because human beings
are notoriously bad at accurately predicting their own behavior.)

Despite these cautions, attitudinal research methods can still be
helpful as a way of uncovering a participant's mental model, which can
then be used to shape a design to better meet user expectations.

**Behavioral research methods** are based on direct observation as a
study participant interacts with a prototype or finished product.
Researchers often prefer these methods since they are able to deliver
more reliable insights based on real-world scenarios. Research methods
that study a user's actual actions include things like eye tracking, A/B
tests, tree tests, [first-click
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/first-click-testing),
and also user analytics.

There are also a number of research methods---user interviews and [task
analysis](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/task-analysis),
for example---that can produce either attitudinal or behavioral data. In
any situation, best practices include collecting a variety of both
attitudinal and behavioral data. \

Remote vs. in-person user research 
-----------------------------------

The biggest and most obvious difference between in-person and remote
research is that with remote research, the participant and the
researcher are in different locations. 

Here is a quick run down of some of the advantages most often associated
with each approach:

**In-person research:**

-   Is easier to moderate because participants tend to be more attentive
    and can ask questions if they get stuck.
-   Offer a more complete view of participant responses because
    researchers can combine verbal response and task-related actions
    with non-verbal cues.
-   Provides more opportunities to ask follow-up questions or make
    additional in-the-moment inquiries about participant choices or
    thought processes.
-   Gives researchers more control over the environment, including types
    of devices and software being used, internet connection, data
    security, noise, interruptions, and so forth.
-   Creates better group dynamics, which can contribute to idea
    generation and useful dialog depending on the type of research being
    performed.

**Remote research:**

-   Allows for much greater scheduling flexibility since there is no
    travel required.
-   Is less expensive because there are no space-related costs and both
    recruitment and compensation costs are often lower than for
    in-person studies.
-   Makes it easier to recruit a larger, more diverse group of
    participants.
-   Comes with fewer recruitment constraints such as availability or
    geographic location.
-   Can provide a more accurate reflection of real-life usage because
    participants can use their own equipment.

Remote research isn't suited for all research methods. For example,
[ethnographic field
studies](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ethnography)
are particularly hard to replicate remotely. 

But in many cases, the benefits of in-person research can be replicated
in remote scenarios, giving researchers the best of both worlds:
ultimate flexibility and cost-effectiveness without sacrificing the
quality of responses. 

Moderated vs. unmoderated user research methods
-----------------------------------------------

The difference between moderated and unmoderated research methods is the
role of the researcher. 

**Unmoderated or automated research** involves unobserved tests that a
participant can complete at their own pace. The participant interacts
with the product via an online platform or software that prompts them to
answer specific questions or perform specific tasks. 

The nature of this kind of test makes it easier, less expensive, and
faster to run than research facilitated by a professional moderator. The
data from unmoderated research studies tends to be quantitative rather
than qualitative, although some unmoderated tests include the option for
participants to provide a recorded self-narration of their actions
during the test. 

Examples of research methods that are often unmoderated include surveys,
first-click tests, A/B tests, and user analytics.

**In moderated research**, a facilitator observes---either in person or
remotely---as participants take part in the study. This real-time
moderation allows researchers to adapt their script and process in
response to participant actions and engagement, and also to ask
follow-up questions that probe more deeply into why participants make
certain choices. 

Because of the human element of introducing a facilitator, moderated
tests can be more time consuming and more expensive. They can also
require additional expertise and preparation since there is a specific
skill set required to moderate a study effectively. And because the
output usually includes a good deal of qualitative data, analyzing the
results can also take a little more time.

Examples of research methods that are usually moderated include
interviews, ethnographic field studies, focus groups, and task analysis.

Which user research method should you use?
------------------------------------------

The answer to this question is, of course, "it depends."

The right user research method for any given study depends on a
combination of factors, including which stage of product development
you're in, the nature of your research question, the types (and number)
of participants you're looking to recruit, your budget, and whether or
not there's a pandemic making in-person research particularly
challenging!

There are several good frameworks out there to help you choose the right
method, and we cover them in-depth in the upcoming chapter on [how to
choose a user research
method](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/how-to-choose-a-research-method).

Knowing when to use which type of research is an essential instinct for
UX researchers to hone. In the [last
chapter](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-types),
we gave an overview of the different types of user research methods. In
this chapter, we're going to take a closer look at qualitative and
quantitative research, in particular.

Why? Because combining qualitative and quantitative UX research methods
is the most effective way to create a comprehensive portrait of your
customers' wants and needs. 

Properly acquired and analyzed, the high-volume of data in quantitative
research helps you uncover what is happening---trends, issues, and
opportunities---and prove hypotheses. 

Qualitative research, on the other hand, adds a layer of humanity to
user data, delivering details that add depth and a deeper understanding
of not only what's happening, but why it's happening. 

The trick to choosing the right user research method is knowing what
kind of data you need to answer your research question. In this chapter,
we'll go over the differences between qualitative and quantitative UX
research methods, the pros and cons of each one, and how they complement
each other in a mixed methods approach. 

### In this chapter:

-   The differences between qualitative and quantitative research
-   When to do qualitative vs. quantitative user research
-   Research methodologies for both qualitative and quantitative
    research
-   Recruiting participants for qualitative vs quantitative studies
-   Qualitative vs quantitative data analysis

The differences between qualitative and quantitative research 
--------------------------------------------------------------

The primary difference between qualitative and quantitative UX research
lies in the nature of the data---which impacts how it is collected and
then analyzed.

![A simple decision tree for quant v.
qual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/61a9a7f6d54f7348b34210f1_qual-or-quant.png)

In qualitative research, researchers gain insight through direct
observation of a small group of people, often engaging in follow-up
questions that dig deeper into the "why" behind certain attitudes and
behaviors. Qualitative research can also be adapted on the fly as
researchers adjust study protocols based on participant engagement and
response. 

Common qualitative research methods include
[interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews),
[focus
groups](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/focus-groups),
[field
studies](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/field-studies),
[qualitative usability
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/qualitative-usability-testing),
and co-design sessions.

Quantitative research, on the other hand, usually involves collecting
large quantities of numerical data from a much larger group of people,
often indirectly through surveys or analytics tools. Insights are
derived using mathematical analysis of the data to quantify a problem by
answering the questions, "How much?" and "How many?" Because statistical
significance is a key goal of qualitative research, testing protocols
are rigid and not subject to change over the course of a study. 

Common quantitative research methods include [user
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/qualitative-usability-testing),
surveys, [click
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/first-click-testing),
card sorts, and [A/B
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/a-b-testing).

### Let's take a closer look.

##### **Qualitative vs quantitative UX research methods**

![Qualitative vs quantitative UX research
methods](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/61a7c61cea2cff4f2143d4a9_qual-vs-quant_optimized.png)

Whatever kind of product you're working on, and wherever you are in the
product development cycle, it's important to know which kind of UX
research will get you the answers you need. 

When to do qualitative user research
------------------------------------

We love qualitative UX research at User Interviews. Qualitative methods
can provide valuable insight when you are trying to:

-   Come up with new ideas.
-   Gain deeper insight into customer needs.
-   Identify design problems.
-   Formulate hypotheses.

The use cases for qualitative research stretch across the product
development and design cycle---when you're brainstorming, in discovery,
validating a concept, testing the usability and desirability of a
finished product, preparing a go-to-market strategy, iterating post
launch, doing a redesign... every step of the way.

Qualitative research brings the human element to bear on whatever
question you're exploring. It lets you hear what people think in their
own words. It helps you compile detailed information that is both
valuable in itself and also a great jumping off point for additional
research directed at solving specific challenges. 

When to do quantitative user research
-------------------------------------

Stakeholders love hard data. Compiling data to drive a strategic
research agenda with management is far from the only reason to engage in
quantitative UX research, but it is often the catalyst for major
research efforts. 

Quantitative research can help you to:

-   Establish critical benchmarks.
-   Identify problem areas.
-   Begin to define specific problems.
-   Elevate one solution over another.
-   Prioritize projects.

It can also lay the foundation for (and help you make the case for)
doing the qualitative research you need to find solutions to problems. 

Quantitative UX research is most commonly applied when you already have
a working product and are trying to evaluate its usability. It can also
be very effective at uncovering the answers to broad, high-level
questions through statistical analysis to either validate or disprove
your hypothesis. 

Qualitative research methodologies
----------------------------------

Qualitative research methods---which may be behavioral or attitudinal,
moderated or unmoderated, remote or in-person---can be further
categorized into five different types. 

Some kinds of qualitative research (like grounded theory) are
infrequently utilized in a UX research context. They're more commonly
used by researchers in the fields of sociology, anthropology, and other
social sciences from which they originated. But that's not to say you
couldn't use grounded theory for UX research, if a problem called for
it. 

### Five types of qualitative research

#### 1. Ethnographic research

In [ethnographic research
methods](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ethnography),
researchers observe user behavior in participants' natural environment.
This approach is a powerful way to understand context, observe
real-world product use, and gain deep cultural insights about
participants' day-to-day lives. 

#### 2. Narrative research

Humans are wired for story, which is why narrative research often packs
an outsized punch. In this approach, researchers run in-depth interviews
with a very small number of participants in order to create a cohesive
narrative that reveals themes and patterns.

#### 3. Phenomenology

Phenomenology uses a combination of interviews, observation,
documentation, video recordings, etc. to help researchers understand the
what, how, and why behind a particular phenomenon or event. This method
helps describe and interpret lived experiences, which in turn helps
uncover participants' perceptions and motivations.

#### 4. Grounded Theory

While phenomenology aims to describe an event, grounded theory aims to
explain why an event happens, by uncovering the social and psychological
processes behind it. This is typically done through a combination of
user interviews with 20 to 60 participants and in-depth document
research.

#### 5. Case Study

The purpose of the case study is to relate, in detail, a real example of
a specific type of experience. The nature of a case study can be either
explanatory or exploratory, but the aim in either case is to gain access
to deep understanding of how things happen in the real world. 

Quantitative research methodologies
-----------------------------------

As with qualitative research, quantitative methods can be broken down
into categories---which type of quantitative approach is most
appropriate depends on the nature of the issue you are researching, the
type of information you are after, and the study protocols involved. 

The following decision tree illustrates the process:

![[Source](https://libguides.sdstate.edu/c.php?g=364511&p=2462279)](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/61a7c6cfcbad4f1bbd8866f5_flow-chart.png)

### Four types of quantitative research 

#### 1. Descriptive 

Descriptive research uses a wide variety of methods to identify the
characteristics and frequency of a study topic while also looking at
associated trends and categories. It relies on observation and
measurement to deliver insights into the what, where, when and how
something happens.

#### 2. Correlational

Correlational research looks at how two or more variables that are
similar and interdependent relate to each other. This type of research
uses mathematical analysis to show how each variable affects the other.
Results are often presented using diagrams or statistics.  
#### 3. Quasi-experimental (aka causal-comparative)

This type of research looks at the cause-and-effect relationship between
two variables---one dependent and one independent---that are not related
to each other.

#### 4. Experimental

Used to verify an argument, experimental research takes a theoretical
approach that focuses on a theory and then helps researchers identify
whether a given statement is right or wrong. 

Recruiting participants for qualitative vs quantitative studies
---------------------------------------------------------------

Quality research---whether it's qualitative or quantitative---requires
quality participants.  But [the challenges of recruiting are
different](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/recruiting)
depending on which research methods you're using.

In quantitative research, you start with a large 'population'---the
entire group you want to study---and then you create a 'sample,' which
is a subset of the specific individuals who will participate in the
study. This process is often called 'sampling.'  For this to work, you
need two things: 1) a large sample size, and 2) a solid sampling design
that guarantees a random sample, which is critical to ensure truly
accurate results. 

In qualitative research (especially for B2B or other highly targeted
studies) the key is finding the perfect participants---people who fit
your customer profile exactly in terms of not only demographics and
geographics, but also psychographics, behavior, and specific criteria
relevant to the study parameters. Recruiting participants for
qualitative studies involves non-random sampling and appropriate
screening to deliver the best results.

[User Interviews can help](https://www.userinterviews.com/) with both
types of recruiting, but we're especially great at helping researchers
fill qualitative studies that require vetted, good-fit participants who
meet the specific criteria of your study.\

-----------------------------------------

Once you've collected your data, what next? 

Regardless of whether your data is qualitative or quantitative, it isn't
much use to anyone until it's been analyzed and synthesized. The methods
you use to analyze your data will depend on the methods you used to
gather it---and unsurprisingly, there's quite a lot of difference
between quantitative and qualitative research analysis.

We'll be covering user [research data
analysis](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/research-analysis)
in more detail in a later chapter. But here's what you need to know in a
nutshell.

### Analyzing qualitative data

Qualitative data to yield a wealth of information, but not all of it is
relevant to your research goals. Qualitative analysis involves sifting
through the raw data to find patterns, themes, and stories that tell you
something meaningful about the product, the user, or both.

#### Qualitative findings are:

-   Estimates, impressions, and interpretations
-   Informed by the knowledge and experience of the researcher
-   Unstructured or semi-structured in nature

#### They are used to determine:

-   General strengths and weaknesses of a design or process
-   Average scores across multiple participants
-   Themes and trends
-   Correlation or causation between two or more variables

#### They are analyzed using:

-   The application of metadata to help organize unstructured data
-   Qualitative content analysis, which tracks instances, positioning,
    and intended meaning of specific words and phrases
-   Thematic analysis, which identifies themes and patterns
-   Discourse analysis, which looks at the nature of communication
    within a specific social context

### Analyzing quantitative data

Quantitative analysis is comparatively (deceptively) straightforward. It
involves a lot of number crunching---but what you are doing at heart is
trying to understand how people use a certain product, what problems
they may be experiencing, and where improvements could be made by
looking for patterns in the data.

#### Quantitative findings are:

-   Statistically meaningful 
-   Replicable
-   Measurable data points expressed in numerical form
-   Structured data that is easy to organize and search using a
    relational database

#### They are used to determine:

-   How many
-   How much
-   How frequently

#### They are analyzed using:

-   Mathematical and statistical analysis

Comparing advantages and disadvantages
--------------------------------------

We know there's a lot of information in this chapter, so before we wrap
up with a brief discussion of mixed methods, let\'s take a moment to
summarize what we've learned about each type of research with a list of
pros and cons.

### Advantages of qualitative research

-   Gives you first-hand insight into what people are really thinking
    and feeling
-   Reveals nuances and subtleties that quantitative data conceals
-   Uncovers the cause-and-effect connections that shape experience and
    drive behaviors
-   Works with a smaller sample size
-   Allows for a flexible and nuanced approach 
-   Provides study participants with a more expansive way to express
    their feelings and share their experience
-   Delivers emotionally driven, narrative-style evidence that can be
    very persuasive
-   Reveals why something is happening 
-   Helps identify solutions to UX problems 
-   Inspires future studies

### Disadvantages of qualitative research

-   Incremental expense---can have a higher upfront cost than
    quantitative research since most teams already run some sort of
    analytics by default
-   Time required---can take a long time to coordinate and run (though
    getting help with recruiting, one of the most time-consuming parts
    of the process, can streamline things substantially)
-   Risk of researcher bias, which can influence conclusions consciously
    or subconsciously
-   Non-traditional validation---the subjective, open-ended nature and
    small participant pools do not align with conventional standards for
    reliability and validity such as statistically representative data
-   Non-replicable---neither the study nor the results can be replicated
    since you cannot control for variables like the context, conditions,
    researcher knowledge, researcher approach, etc.
-   Narrow context---you cannot extrapolate results to make confident
    generalizations about a broader audience.
-   Challenging analysis---accurate interpretation requires expert
    knowledge of both the subject matter and qualitative research
    methodology. 

### Advantages of quantitative research

-   Provides some level of statistical significance
-   Reduces random noise
-   Allows for fast results
-   Lends itself to rapid analysis 
-   Delivers comparatively more objective results\*
-   Supports helpful data visualizations
-   Simplifies connecting the dots between UX improvements and team
    objectives
-   Enables test replication

###### **\*Caveat:** The aim of quantitative research is to provide unbiased and objective results. But, despite best intentions, there are always variables that can influence a study. Quantitative methods do offer a greater opportunity to find statistical significance, but only when the data is collected, analyzed, and presented correctly. For example, if a survey design is biased---even unintentionally---the data will also be biased. Excellence in quantitative research requires a high level of expertise and knowledge about each step in the process.  

### Disadvantages of quantitative research

-   Limited insight---quantitative research can reveal the what, but it
    can't tell you the why. It can tell you that there is an issue, but
    it can't necessarily identify the specific problem, and it doesn't
    provide a solution.
-   Risk of confirmation bias---researchers may overlook certain
    generative insights due to an over focus on evaluative testing.
-   Limited context---participants' response options are narrowly
    defined. They do not have the opportunity to explain their choices
    or ask for clarification about questions. 
-   Reliance on researcher assumptions---the context-bound nature of
    responses means that researchers need to make their own assumptions
    about how participants interpreted questions and why they chose
    certain responses.
-   Large sample size requirement---statistical significance requires a
    large pool of participants.
-   High analytical skills required---an inadequate knowledge of how to
    apply statistical analysis can influence data interpretation and
    negatively affect the accuracy of results.

For best results, mix methods
-----------------------------

Oftentimes, the best way to answer your research question with both
certainty and nuance is to take a mixed methods approach. 

**Mixed methods user research** is exactly what it sounds like---the
practice of using both kinds of research methods in a single study. Side
note: If you're blending multiple qualitative methods (and you often
will) or multiple quantitative methods---but not the two
together---that's referred to as hybrid research. Similar, but
different.

Many UX researchers opt for a mixed method approach. That's because
quantitative and qualitative methods are actually highly complementary.
Quantitative research helps you identify specific problems by measuring
the 'what' and the 'how', and provides hard data that can be quickly
analyzed and understood. Meanwhile, qualitative data helps you uncover
the 'why' behind an issue or opportunity. Each type of data helps fill
in the gaps left by the other, giving you a holistic picture of exactly
what's happening, why it's happening, and how you should address it.

Mixing methods also helps you avoid making false assumptions that can
cause you to travel down the wrong path, wasting time and resources on
developing a solution that users don't really need. 

For example, if quantitative research shows that a particular step in
your conversion journey takes twice as long as any other part of the
process, you might assume that that step is simply more time-consuming.
However, if you then run a qualitative test to observe how people do
that step and collect direct feedback about the experience, you may
learn that the instructions are confusing and users are getting hung up
on trying to interpret them. 

The key to successful UX research is knowing which methods will give you
the answers you need, and how they can be combined with other methods to
give you the most complete and accurate picture possible.

User Research
Method](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/how-to-choose-a-research-method),

[Getting started with user
research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/ux-research-basics)
can be intimidating. Even for experienced UX researchers, the variety of
possible approaches to any given research project can feel
daunting---with so many methods, which one should you choose? What is
the best way to answer your research question? Is it the most efficient
way that will keep your project within scope, under budget, and on
time? 

In the previous two chapters, we gave an overview of the [different
types of user research
methods](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-types),
and dove deeper into the important differences between [qualitative and
quantitative
research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/qualitative-vs-quantitative-vs-mixed-methods).
You may already have an idea, based on what you read and the
pre-existing UXR knowledge you're bringing to the table, which methods
you want to use for your current project.

In this chapter, we're going to help you solidify those choices, and
introduce you to a few different frameworks for choosing the right user
research method for any project that comes your way, or any research
question that might crop up.

These frameworks---which can be adapted to your own research practice
and the realities of your organization, customers, and unique
constraints---will help you answer the question "which UX research
method should I use?" efficiently and effectively every time.

### In this chapter:

-   Start with clearly stated research questions and goals
-   Pick the right method for your research question
-   User research frameworks
-   The right methods for each stage of product development 
-   Mapping UX research methods to decisions
-   A 3-dimensional framework for UXR 
-   Additional considerations

Without further ado, here's how to choose the right methods for your UX
research study.

Start with clearly stated research questions and goals
------------------------------------------------------

As ever, you'll want to start with well-defined goals and clear research
questions. 

If you're not already clear about the goals of your research, stop here.
Do not pass go. Do not collect \$200 in [gift card
incentives](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ux-research-incentives).

Circle back to the chapter on [creating a user research
plan](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/create-user-research-plan)
for help identifying your research goals, which should be statements
about what you're trying to learn from your research.

**To define your research goals, ask yourself:**

-   What do I want to know?
-   What don't I know?
-   How will I know when I've learned it?
-   What company goals will this work support?
-   Where am I in the product development process?
-   What decision will this research enable? 
-   What are the anticipated outcomes of this research?

You'll want to further refine the answers to these questions through
[stakeholder research](#)---your key stakeholders can clarify business
goals and the kinds of decisions your research needs to enable to be
successful. 

Good research questions are [specific, actionable, and
practical](https://medium.com/mule-design/research-questions-are-not-interview-questions-7f90602eb533).
They also contain clues about who you need to recruit and which methods
you'll need to use. 

**Some example of good research questions:**

-   Are our customers able to successfully navigate to the support page
    on our site?
-   What are the primary motivating factors behind the decision to
    purchase pet insurance?
-   What tools do college students use to keep track of their schedules?

Pick the right method for your research question
------------------------------------------------

In the likely event that you aren't binge reading the UX Research Field
Guide in a single sitting, it's probably helpful to take a moment to
revisit the different types of user research, along with the different
questions they can help you answer. 

User research methods can be divided along several different axes. They
can be:

#### Quantitative or qualitative

**Qualitative UX research** involves collecting data through direct
observation of a small group of people in order to assess behavior and
provide context. Qualitative methods produce unstructured or
semi-structured observational findings like comments, preferences, and
motivations.

Qualitative research helps you answer the questions: 

-   "Why?" 
-   "How?"
-   "How can we fix this?"

**Quantitative UX research**, on the other hand, involves collecting
data from a much larger group of people in order to quantify a problem
and uncover patterns through statistical analysis. 

Quantitative research helps you answer the questions: 

-   "How much?"
-   "How many?" 
-   "How often?"

#### Generative or evaluative

**Generative (discovery) UX research** (also foundational, or
exploratory research) uses direct observation, deep inquiry, and careful
analysis to generate ideas (go figure) and discover opportunities for
innovation that will meet a specific and real need in the market.
Generative research is often (but not always) qualitative. 

Discovery methods help you answer questions like:

-   Who are our users?
-   What are their problems?
-   How do they think?
-   Is there a real need for this solution?
-   What should we build?

**Evaluative UX research** is used to evaluate people's responses to a
product or solution. It is used throughout the product development cycle
to test and validate the appeal, intuitiveness, and functionality of
ideas, prototypes, and finished products.

Evaluative methods help you answer questions like:

-   Which design do users prefer?
-   Is this interface intuitive?
-   Does this feature work as intended?
-   Are we building the right thing, correctly?
-   What could be better?

#### Attitudinal or behavioral

**​​Attitudinal UX research** methods (like surveys and [focus
groups](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/focus-groups),
for example) rely on self-reported data about people's beliefs,
perceptions, and expectations. Take what participants say with a grain
of salt, especially if they're referring to future behaviors---even the
most self-aware user can't predict the future.

Attitudinal research can help you answer questions like:

-   What do people think about this feature?
-   What do people *say* they want?
-   How do people describe their current problem?
-   What are their mental models?

**Behavioral UX research** methods (like [A/B
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/a-b-testing)
and [first click
tests](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/first-click-testing))
are based on direct observations about how a study participant interacts
with a prototype or finished product. 

Behavioral research can help you answer questions like:

-   How do users interact with this new feature?
-   How long does it take users to complete a workflow?
-   Which CTA has a higher conversion rate?
-   Can people navigate the UI?

User research frameworks
------------------------

A user research framework is a systematic way of categorizing research
methodologies and approaches to guide decisions about which method to
use, when. Whether you're a solo UX researcher or are working within a
larger team, a reliable framework will provide consistency and can
dramatically speed up research planning and decision-making.

They can be intricate, like this behemoth from UX researcher [Lena
Borodina](https://uxplanet.org/which-ux-research-method-to-use-2ca910a9b68e):

![[Source](https://overflow.io/s/E42BS4/?node=8fdcdf0f)](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/61a9ab4e3e8856d5d1f49d2f_Screen%20Shot%202021-12-03%20at%2012.29.36%20AM.png)

Or they can be simpler, like Tomer Sharon\'s [Lean User Research
framework:](https://medium.com/mytake/validating-product-ideas-lean-user-research-by-tomer-sharon-e3c805601035)

![[Source](https://medium.com/mytake/validating-product-ideas-lean-user-research-by-tomer-sharon-e3c805601035)](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/61a9ad31eefde3336b90c00b_lean%20uxr%201.png)

The best framework is the one that works for you. In order for it to be
used effectively, a framework needs to be relevant to your team, your
business goals, and your internal resources. If you don't have the
budget or people power for long ethnographic field studies, don't
include those types of studies in your framework. (Remember, frameworks
can evolve.)

All of the frameworks in this chapter can and should be adapted to your
own practice as necessary. We'll cover how to map UX research methods
to:\

-   Where you are in the product development cycle
-   The decisions you want to enable
-   The nature of the data collected

Let's hop to it!

The right methods for each stage of product development 
--------------------------------------------------------

In the very first chapter, What Is User Research?, you learned about how
(and why) to conduct user research at [different stages of the product
development
cycle](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/what-is-user-research).

As you progress through the discovery, design, testing, implementation,
and post-launch phases, the problems you need to solve will change.
You'll ask different questions, which will require different research
methods to answer.

![[NN/g\'s UX Research Cheat
Sheet](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/)](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/61a8ea0463291e28ab9555bf_wELrjfNxq1SOEYktbBMPL-LTlxmvXTE7ZnD_B21WaTTaO-AKFD7V-BsQTVvFk1HhLJsWfcSHIWX5jVuz2UvE33irinTLLUhbu-uqKzujAYDvt5X_EGuUfvO5vviTTUFU6TKlnPvt.png)

### Discovery stage (pre-prototype)

Most projects begin with some
[discovery](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/discovery-methods),
in which you're trying to pinpoint the problem and get a clearer picture
of who you're solving it for. 

The goals at this stage are to explore new directions, develop a
detailed understanding of (potential) user needs and their context, and
uncover opportunities. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches are
used during this phase.

Conducting UX research during discovery helps you **empathize** and
**strategize.**

#### Key discovery methods

[**Stakeholder
Interviews**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/internal-stakeholder-interviews)---Understanding
what your stakeholders ultimately value and need to know is a necessary
component of effective user research. Part of a user researcher's role
is to align and articulate both business and user goals, and find where
they intersect. 

[**Ethnography**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/ethnography)---Ethnography
is all about observing people and their habits in context (their natural
habitats, if you want to get zoological about it). Field studies and
online ethnographic studies can help you understand how people behave in
groups and how they might interact with your product outside of a lab
environment. What people do is so often different from what they report,
and ethnographic studies can be a great way of getting around this
issue.

[**Diary
studies**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/diary-studies)---When
you need to understand long-term user behavioral patterns, diary studies
are a great option. They provide insights into habits, changes over
time, motivations, and long-term customer journeys. And they can be a
solid alternative to ethnographic field studies when you're on a limited
budget.  

[**Focus
groups**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/focus-groups)---Focus
groups are not exactly the, ahem, darling of UX research circles these
days. But they have their uses, especially when it comes to market
research. Focus groups allow you to observe a lot of people relatively
quickly. When you are very early in developing and marketing your
product, this type of research can be useful in getting a broad view
into the audience you seek to serve. 

[**Generative user
interviews**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-interviews)---In-depth
user interviews typically involve talking to participants one-on-one,
asking them a set of non-leading questions, with an emphasis on past
behaviors and perceptions. User interviews are valuable throughout the
product development cycle, but are especially important in the early
stages---the things you learn might confirm your hypotheses or lead to
wildly different conclusions that reshape the direction of your inquiry.

##### 📖 **Read more about** [**Discovery Research Methods**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/discovery-methods)

### Concept validation and testing stage (prototype and build)

At this point, you have a good sense of your market, your users, and
their needs. You've come up with an idea for a solution, are actively
building (or have built) a prototype, and are ready for feedback.  

This stage of product development is about [evaluating your solutions
and validating your
decisions](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/evaluative-methods)
through both qualitative (formative) and quantitative means. The goals
of testing are to validate conceptual fit, evaluate the usability of the
design, and inform changes.

Eventually, you will reach a \"go/no-go\" decision point, when you
transition into a period in which you are continually improving the
design direction that you have chosen to reduce the risk of execution.

Conducting UX research during this phase helps you **optimize** and
**execute.**

#### Key validation and testing methods

[**Qualitative usability
testing**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/qualitative-usability-testing)---This
method involves having participants think aloud as they interact with a
prototype or product, allowing researchers to evaluate implicit and
explicit cues and find patterns quickly. 

[**Task
analysis**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/task-analysis)---Task
analysis helps you better understand your user's goals, and how they go
about achieving them. This can be coupled with a variety of other
methods, and is an important aspect of evaluating the overall user
experience for most apps.

[**A/B testing and multivariate
testing**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/a-b-testing)---Whether
you use A/B test, A/B/C test, single variant test, or multivariate test,
the goal is to collect quantitative data on which version of your
product best achieves the goal of the test---generally a hybrid of a
business and user goal, for instance conversion rate on an ecommerce
site.

[**First click
testing**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/first-click-testing)---This
is just what it sounds like. First click testing---in which you record
the first click someone makes to accomplish their goal and analyze the
results---is a popular way to assess the user's ability to efficiently
and effectively complete a task.

**Card sorting and** [**tree
testing**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/tree-testing)**---**Card
sorting and tree testing are methods for testing your information
architecture (IA), i.e. how you categorize and label content. Card
sorts, which involve users grouping topics into categories, can provide
great insight into your user's mental models and how you should organize
your content. Tree tests---in which users are tasked with finding
information in a sitemap---are often used as a followup method to
evaluate how intuitive your site navigation is.

**Accessibility testing**---The validation and testing stage should not
be the first time accessibility crosses your mind; ---accessible design
begins with thoughtful planning and research design.  By the time you
get to this stage of product development, you should be using
accessibility testing to stress test prototypes or products that have
already been designed with accessibility in mind. In addition to running
your product through accessibility checking tools, consider conducting
qualitative usability studies with participants with disabilities.

### On-going listening (post-launch) 

You've launched a product... congratulations! 

Now, keep researching it!

No, seriously---user research doesn't (or shouldn't) stop once you've
launched a product or feature. "Set it and forget it" is not a smart
product strategy. [Ongoing listening
methods](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/continuous-research-methods)
help keep your product useful, impactful, and relevant over the
long-haul.

The goals of post-launch research are to understand how well your
product is performing, assess how well it continues to address customer
needs, and identify opportunities for improvement. Methods are typically
quantitative (summative) in nature, and allow you to measure product
performance against itself or its competition.

Conducting UX research after launch helps you **assess** and
**iterate.**

#### Key ongoing listening methods

[**Feedback
surveys**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/continuous-user-feedback-surveys)**---**There's
a variety of survey types and tools that can help you meet your goals,
from user intercept (in-app) surveys, to NPS surveys, to longer surveys
that dig into specific aspects of the user experience. Like other
methods at this stage, ongoing listening surveys typically require some
cross-functional collaboration to do effectively. Talk to your product
team to find out where and when an in-app survey would be most
effective, partner with marketing to launch and monitor an NPS survey,
and coordinate with customer development to segment and send email
surveys to existing customers.

[**Analytics**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-analytics)---Analytics
can be a treasure trove of great quantitative data if you know how to
analyze them and connect insight to action. Keeping a close track on key
user flows, in-app behaviors, and business metrics will help you see
changes over time. 

[**Bug reports and support
tickets**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/integrating-support-sales-and-product-feedback)---Bugs
come up and need to be fixed. That's just the reality. Make sure you
have good bug reporting and systems to address them rapidly. Your dev
team is probably on top of this, but you can use this data to understand
where current or historical frustrations may have impacted the user
experience in ways you wouldn't have known otherwise. Similarly, FAQ and
support desk reporting can help you understand where users are getting
stuck. Taking proactive steps to clear up these moments in the product
itself will improve the user experience and make your support team oh so
happy.\

Mapping UX research methods to decisions
----------------------------------------

Research is systematic inquiry. If it is not systematic, you're not
researching---you're just being a busybody. To quote [Roberta
Dombrowski,](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/a-framework-for-decision-driven-research)
VP of User Research at User Interviews:

> \"Research is the act of acquiring knowledge---we could literally
> conduct research on any topic under the sun. That endless potential
> scope is why it\'s so important that, as practitioners, the research
> we are leading and conducting is focused and aimed at enabling
> decisions for our organizations.\"\

At User Interviews, we keep our research focused by using our own
[Decision Driven Research
Framework](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/a-framework-for-decision-driven-research),
which is centered on the belief that the purpose of research is to
enable decisions for your company, product, or service. 

### A framework for Decision Driven Research

In this framework, the idea is to map your research methods to the types
of decisions you want to enable. There are 4 types of decisions:

-   **Vision decisions** establish a potential company, product, or
    service direction. To enable vision decisions, you should choose
    methods that give you clarity on participants' big-picture beliefs,
    philosophies, and experiences.
-   **Strategy decisions** determine how you will achieve your vision.
    To enable strategic decisions, you should choose methods that give
    you detailed insights into participants' big-picture beliefs,
    philosophies, and experiences.
-   **Definition decisions** determine whether or not you pursue a
    specific design direction. To enable these decisions, you should
    choose methods that allow you to get early feedback on potential
    design directions and to better understand how a participant may
    interact with a potential product or service.
-   **Evaluation decisions** concern iterations to existing products or
    services. To enable evaluation decisions, you should choose methods
    that allow you to continuously identify problems, bugs, or confusion
    that customers may encounter during use.

Below is a list of the most common methods we use when conducting
research at User Interviews. For each method, we've created internal
documentation about what the method is, the type of decisions it helps
inform, and the output.

There are 5 stages to doing Decision Driven Research, the first three of
which are all about creating a clear and focused plan for research.
Here's the process in full:

1.  **Identify the decision trigger**. This is the first and most
    important phase, in which you identify that there\'s a decision that
    your team has to make, or a question you need to answer. 
2.  **Scope evidence**. Once you know what decision needs to be made
    (i.e. once you've defined your research goals), take time to review
    whether there is any existing data or evidence that can inform the
    decision or even answer your research questions.
3.  **Define your approach.** If there\'s no existing data or you decide
    you need more information in order to proceed, then it's time to
    figure out which approach or research method will get you the
    answers you need to confidently inform a decision. 
4.  **Explore.** Now that you have a research plan, it's time to go out,
    explore, and gather data. In other words, research!
5.  **Reflect and decide.** Finally, [analyze and
    synthesize](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/research-analysis-synthesis),
    reflect on what you learned, and make informed decisions about what
    to do next.

A 3-dimensional framework for UXR 
----------------------------------

Many teams limit their research opportunities by consistently using the
same familiar methods over and over again. And while it's unlikely you'd
ever need to use *all* the different UX research methods out there on a
single project (what a nightmare), you should be prepared to mix up your
playbook when the research question calls for it.

[Nielsen Norman
Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/)
developed a helpful chart that illustrates where 20 popular methods fall
along the following axes:

**Attitudinal vs. behavioral**---Attitudinal refers to what people say,
while behavioral refers to what they do. Often there's a pretty wide gap
between the two. The most popular research methods blend elements of
these two to capture both what people say and what they do. 

**Qualitative vs. quantitative**---As we've been discussing, qualitative
research data comes from observing behaviors and/or attitudes directly
while quantitative research data is acquired indirectly via an
instrument like a survey or web analytics tool. 

**Context of use**---The final axis of NN/g's three-dimensional
framework looks at how study participants use the product in question
(if indeed they do). Context of use can be defined as:\

-   Natural or near-natural use of the product 
-   Scripted use of the product 
-   Not using the product during the study
-   A hybrid of the above

Using this chart, you can start to hone in on which methods will satisfy
your research goals: 

![[Source](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/)](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/61a8eaefddf7076cc6cd1454_nng.png)

The folks at NN/g are [careful to
note](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/) that
theirs, like all frameworks, is not set in stone. Few of the methods are
fixed in a single place.

> Most of the methods in the chart can move along one or more
> dimensions, and some do so even in the same study, usually to satisfy
> multiple goals. For example, field studies can focus on what people
> say (ethnographic interviews) or what they do (extended observations);
> desirability studies and card sorting have both qualitative and
> quantitative versions; and eye tracking can be scripted or unscripted.

Additional considerations
-------------------------

User research rarely (if, indeed, ever) happens without constraints. You
may be short on time, money, or people power. And that will impact which
methods are available to you.

### Some methods are expensive and time consuming

Say you want to learn about how participants interact with your product
in a real-world context. Field studies would be an obvious choice---you
could observe people in the field, using your product IRL. Great! 

But field studies can take months. 

If you don't have the luxury of time, [diary
studies](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/diary-studies)
would be a solid option for learning about product use in-context. The
best UX research method in this case is the one you can reasonably fit
into your timeline and budget.

### Some methods require more people power

Unmoderated research involves unobserved tests that a participant can
complete at their own pace using tools that prompt them to answer
specific questions or perform specific tasks. The nature of this kind of
test makes it easier, less expensive, and faster to run than research
facilitated by a professional moderator. 

Moderated research requires a moderator (go figure). Researchers observe
as participants complete a study, which allows researchers to respond to
participant actions on the fly and to ask follow-up questions that probe
more deeply into why participants make certain choices. 

Because of the human element of introducing a facilitator, moderated
tests can be more time consuming and more expensive. They can also
require additional expertise and preparation since there is a specific
skill set required to moderate a study effectively. And because the
output usually includes a good deal of qualitative data, analyzing the
results can also take a little more time.

You shouldn\'t skip moderated research (which includes methods like
interviews and qualitative usability testing). You really [only need
about 5
participants](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/find-good-research-participants),
anyway. But if you're trying to collect data at scale, whether that's
qualitative or quantitative, remember that there's only so much time in
a day. Be realistic about how many facilitated research sessions your
team can handle within a project's timeline.

### Some methods need specialized tools

We don't have a usability testing lab at User Interviews. Nor do we have
a closet full of eye tracking devices or other biometric technology. In
fact, we don't have a lot of the things some user research teams rely on
as part of their practice. 

And that works for us! We're a [fully remote
company](https://www.userinterviews.com/about), and we conduct remote UX
research. We don't need to monitor people's heart rates or do research
in clinically controlled environments to answer our research questions.

We also don't pay for all-in-one research platforms. That's less about
cost, and more about the fact that we'd rather assemble our own toolkit
with products that let us bring our own participants ([recruited with
User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/), naturally). 

But that's just us. The [tools *you* need for user
research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-chapter/user-research-tools)
might be different. Or not---many user research methods don't require
special software. 

If your research question can be answered by simple means---do that.
Research that's hard to do doesn't get done.
