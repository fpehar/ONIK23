Here's the thing about user research. It's incredibly important, but it
doesn't have to be that hard.¬†\

‚Äç

Hear us out: We know it's hard to find the time, and the budget, and
manage the logistics, and do the recruiting, gather and analyze
insights, run presentations, and the list goes on. Those things are hard
and this field guide exists in large part to make those things a little
easier.\

‚Äç

What doesn't need to be that hard is getting started, doing something
instead of nothing, regularly practicing the bold act of actually
talking to your users, customers, and would-be users and customers.¬†\

‚Äç

If you read nothing else, and we really hope you WILL read something
else, read this. If you are already humming along with a kickass
research program, feel free to subscribe to more targeted chapters that
suit your needs by clicking anywhere you see \"Subscribe.\" Or just
navigate to the Field Guide index and explore.\

‚Äç

Without further ado, here are some well-loved tips among the UX research
community to conduct effective user research and interviews. Consider
this your MVR (minimum viable research) cheat sheet.

‚Äç

Minimum viable user research tips
---------------------------------

### Recruit about 5 "good" people

While qualitative research can be time consuming, the good news is you
really only need to talk to about 5 people before you hit a point of
diminishing returns in terms of insights. Of course, that entirely
hinges on finding the right people. This doesn't have to be
complicated.\

-   **Know your learning goals** for research. Use that to determine
    your right audience.
-   **Determine if you need existing or target users**---a good rule of
    thumb is for new power features of your existing product, talk to
    existing users, for out-of-the-box perspective on a brand new
    feature or product, talk to your target users
-   **Build a simple screener survey** to identify and filter out people
    who will give you diversity and relevance of insight. Pro tip: Don't
    over-screen. We see this a lot.
-   **Distribute your survey** to a list you manage or using a
    third-party service or platform.
-   **Contact 5 people** to set up in-person or remote sessions with the
    relevant directions, web meeting links, etc. You might do a second
    round if you get a couple no-shows or you didn't get the insights
    you were looking for. It does happen.
-   **Compress the timeframe of sessions** so you can focus, build
    momentum, and get to action faster.\

‚Äç

Here's where we subtly throw in that [User Interviews](#) makes all this
that much easier and sometimes cheaper, but of course you can do this
manually if you like. Google Sheets + Craigslist + Mail merge FTW!\

##### **üìñ Learn more about** [**Recruiting for UX¬†Research**](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/recruiting)

### Write a quick moderator guide 

This need not take more than 15 minutes or so for MVR. Don't go into a
session without a simple set of questions.\

-   **Plop your research mission and learning goals on top of your
    guide** for a steady reminder and thing to go back to as your
    session progresses. Make sure whatever else happens---sessions are
    predictable in their unpredictability if nothing else---you get back
    to the matter at hand.
-   **Have a hypothesis or assumption you want to test**, but be totally
    prepared to be wrong and watch out for unconscious bias. The below
    point is your friend here.
-   **Use open ended, why oriented questions**, focus on past behavior
    vs hypothetical future behavior, and avoid adjectives---let your
    participant decide on the adjectives that describe their experience.
-   **Write your opening and closing, verbatim.** Choose something warm,
    authentic to how you actually talk, that puts the participant at
    ease. If you get flustered or things go off script, you can just
    read this in the moment.

‚Äç

### Run an effective session

You are a human, talking to another human. What an amazing opportunity
to get permission to connect with someone you wouldn't otherwise. Be
warm, be authentic, be yourself, just don't get *too* chummy or start
influencing the participant's ideas with your own enthusiasm. Be a
professional.\

-   **Listen lots, talk little**, get comfy with silence. Watch people
    too. What do they do with your prototype, site? Behavior, behavior,
    behavior.
-   **Show something if you have something to show,** but focus on one
    thing at a time.
-   **Probe, give context, set expectations** about why you're here and
    what you're trying to accomplish. Don't share your assumptions or
    hypothesis.
-   **Take notes.** If you can spare someone to take notes for you or
    use a transcription or recording service, that means you can really
    focus on being present in the session, which will help you pick up
    on all those juicy micro-moments.

‚Äç

### Review, and share, results 

Don't let your research die in the session itself. Again, don't
over-complicate this if time is not a luxury you have.\

-   **Highlight key insights**, quotes, thoughts from each session
    immediately after, if you can.
-   **Review all your notes.** Look for themes. Highlight those themes
    and supporting evidence in a document of your choosing, something
    that is easy for you and acceptable to your audience of
    stakeholders.
-   **Share your insights!** Different organizations do this in
    different ways, and we'll cover this in depth later. At a minimum,
    shoot a Slack or email linking to your document and host it
    somewhere people can access it on demand. You've done important
    work. Don't hide it.
-   **Connect with your stakeholders** (product, sprint, design team,
    whoever you're working with on the research) ASAP with your insights
    and move things forward!\

‚Äç

That's it. Of course there's much more to cover, and cover it we will,
but hopefully the above tips empower you to just get out there and do
some research today. Building a regular research habit is the best way
to build discipline in yourself, your organization, and to consistently
show its importance to your product and customers.\

What does User Interviews know about UX research?
-------------------------------------------------

Quite a lot, as it happens.\

‚Äç

For starters, we're a UX research tool---more specifically, User
Interviews is a user research recruiting and participant management
platform. We exist to solve the pain point of user research
recruiting---especially for qualitative research studies with niche
requirements.¬†\

‚Äç

For another thing, User Interviews exists in large part because our
founders needed to recruit participants for their own research---and
they hated it. After doing some user research, they found out other
people hated it, too.\

‚Äç

And so, the idea that eventually became User Interviews was born.¬†\

‚Äç

You can read all about how our founders pivoted from a failed startup to
a \$10 million Series A through (meta) user research in [this
article](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/from-failure-to-a-venture-backed-startup-through-meta-user-research).
In addition to being our origin story, it's also a compelling case study
on the power of user research!\

How to use this Field Guide
---------------------------

The UX Research Field Guide is meant to be read cover-to-cover---the
outline roughly follows the UX research process, and the knowledge you
acquire in one module can be applied and built upon in the next.\

‚Äç

Over the course of this Field Guide, we'll dive deeper into the various
UX research methods, as well as the foundational knowledge and research
skills you'll need to effectively plan, recruit for, execute, and report
on your user research efforts.\

‚Äç

But you don't need to read the full Field Guide to get started, and many
of you out there might be seasoned pros just looking to brush up on a
couple topics (hence "Field Guide"). Each chapter is designed to stand
on its own, so you can also skip around to the chapters that are
relevant to you.\

‚Äç

We're relaunching the UX Research Field Guide with 4 refresh and
refreshed modules:

1.  [UX Research
    Fundamentals](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/user-research-fundamentals)
2.  [Planning UX
    Research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/planning-user-research)
3.  [Recruiting for UX
    Research](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/recruiting)
4.  [UX Research
    Methodologies](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide-module/user-research-methods)\

‚Äç

You'll notice that the later modules include a note about upcoming
release dates. Over the coming weeks, we'll be rolling out some pretty
major updates to the content in those modules, including fresh templates
and resources for doing UX research.\

‚Äç

You can still read and find a ton of value in the original chapters, but
we *highly* recommend signing up to receive the UX Research Field Guide
over the course of 10 weekly emails. You'll get the latest edition of
each chapter, along with a top-level summary of the module topic and a
special email-exclusive pearl of user research wisdom from the User
Interviews UXR team.\

‚Äç

You'll *also* receive brand new chapters as they're published. Those
chapters---like the ones on co-design, preference testing, and research
synthesis---are denoted by a "Coming Soon" tag in the Field Guide
itself.¬†¬†\

‚Äç

Don't see one of your favorite methods or a need-to-know topic on our
list of upcoming chapters? Hit me up at <katryna@userinterviews.com> to
request future content.\

‚Äç

And with that... happy researching, folks!\
