## Welcome!


Hi, hello, thank you. We're so---genuinely---glad you're here. \
\
The UX Research Field Guide is a comprehensive how-to guide to user
research. By the time you finish reading, you'll be a total pro at doing
user research---from planning it to conducting sessions to analyzing and
reporting your findings. \
\
This is actually the second edition of the UX Research Field Guide. With
the help of our own User Research team, we've refreshed, redesigned, and
expanded on the original... and we're proud to say we think this version
is even better than the first!\
‍\
We\'ve relaunched with 4 fresh and refreshed modules---UX Research
Fundamentals, Planning UX Research, Recruiting for UX Research, and
UX Research Methodologies. We'll be rolling out some pretty major
updates to modules 5-9, including fresh templates and resources for
doing UX research.\
\
We'll also be publishing lots of brand new chapters in 2022. Sign up,
stay tuned, and happy researching!\
